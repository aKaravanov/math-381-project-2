[Spoken:]
One two three four five six
There was a guy, and his name was Johnny B. The loudest man in the land

Alright
OK
Alright
OK
Alright
OK
Uh huh

How many more times you cross the line
Run for days with eager eyes
Screaming smile left alone
These crazy things you do
In the forest of your mind
Haunted by the loss of time
Feet stuck frozen in the snow
These crazy things you do

Shame
Shame
Shame
Oh oh oh

Shame
Shame
Shame
Oh oh oh

Alright
OK
Alright
OK
Alright
OK
Uh huh

Japanese from head to toe
Red to green, green to gold
Waiting on that buffalo
These crazy things you do

In my mind I see the day
Ah ha ha ha, ah ho ho ho
Red to green and green to gold
These crazy things you do

Shame
Shame
Shame
Oh oh oh

Shame
Shame
Shame
Oh oh oh

Run it over my skin like a cheap plastic knife
In your heart, in your mind put me always aside
Do it over again 'til it cuts to the bone
We can play by the rules or just
Leave it alone

It's a shame
It's a shame
It's a shame
That your heart has turned to stone
Now your heart's turned to stone

Run it over my skin like a cheap plastic knife
In your heart and in your mind
Put me always aside
Do it over again 'til it cuts to the bone
We can play by the rules

It's a shame
It's a shame
It's a shame
