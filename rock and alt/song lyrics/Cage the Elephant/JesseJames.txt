

It's all over now
Put it on the wire, ahuh
Gonna burn it to the ground
Put it on the wire, ahuh

You'll have to put me in my grave
Before I wear a ball and chain
Maybe we should have some fun
Put it on the wire, ahuh

You say my days are numbered
I swear you'll never take me alive

Is this the last dance? Honey c'mon
This is my last chance, Honey c'mon
If it's the last dance, Honey c'mon
Come on by

No sense trying to hide
Put it on the wire, ahuh
Tell me that we're out of time
Put it on the wire, ahuh

Everywhere I go I see
The end is coming after me
Maybe we should have some fun
Put it on the wire, ahuh

You said that it's not funny
I swear, I didn't mean to smile

Is this the last dance? Honey c'mon
This is my last chance, Honey c'mon
If it's the last dance, Honey c'mon
Come on by

Between the flash of lighting and the broken glass
Never heard a sound 'cause Baby we're so fast
Tell my mother I love her, tell her again
Kiss them all goodbye

Is this the last dance? Honey c'mon
This is my last chance, Honey c'mon
If it's the last dance, Honey c'mon
One more time
