Carry me in, held down by my words
And the weight of my sins

Fear, fear of myself
Fear of myself, all these books on the shelf
Yeah they're dusty again

All along the way
People stop and stare
They just look past my face
They see that I'm not there

I fall into that hole
Down, down, down again
All along the way
All along the way

Run, run from my past
Run from my past, I've got hooks in my back
From the first to the last

All along the way
People stop and stare
They just look past my face
They see that I'm not there

I fall into that hole
Down, down, down again
All along the way
All along the way
[x2]

Now, I see, it's me, my splintered eyes
Climbing up the wall, waiting for the fall
Tonight, I think I'll lose my mind
Carry me away, carry me away

I sit and watch the flowers grow
Someday, they'll die
I sit and watch the world below
Carry me away, carry me away
