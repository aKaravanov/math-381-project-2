

I've been tryin real hard... 
To realize
But somethings take a long long
Long long time (a long time)

[Chorus]
Hold the phone
Hit repeat
You got me foamin at the knees
Saw the flame tasted sin 
You burned me once again
Cut the cord, she's a creep
ABERDEEEEN
Way back [x3]

Never saw my dark side
In, in your eyes
Back and forth bloody fingers
Paintin up the sky
The sky

[Repeat Chorus x2]
