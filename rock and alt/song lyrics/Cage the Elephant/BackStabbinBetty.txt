His woman truly was a devil
She wasn't all that honest
She tore him down on every level

You're a no, good, lazy motherfucker
Got a, shit job you worthless motherfucker
You're a, a dead beat, feel sorry for your mother
If I had time, I'd trade you for another

He don't like that
He wants his life back
He wants to go back home

He tried so hard to please her
He sold his soul to keep her happy
But nothin' he did impressed her
She always left him feelin' shitty

This is it, no, this can't be all you bought me
Said I'm, I'm high class, and this is where you brought me
Gonna, strike low just like my momma taught me
You're a low life, you're lucky that you got me

He don't like that
He wants his life back
He wants to go back home

Down deep, way down inside him
The will to leave was growing stronger
And he bit his tongue for so long
He couldn't hold back any longer

You're a two, faced ruthless instigator
You're a low down, triflin' masquerader
You're a cold bitch, controlling conversator
This is too much, I'm out I'll see ya later

She don't like that
But he got his life back
No she don't like that
But he's right back on track
I said he went back, home
