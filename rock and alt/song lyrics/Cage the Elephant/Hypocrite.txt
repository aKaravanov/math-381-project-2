

Tonight
Bleeding from the holes in my face
But I don't wanna give it away
You did it for the family name
Crash collide into space

You
Your favorite color red
I guess that I'm the hypocrite
You're not responsible
I'm responsible

[Pre-chorus:]
Who's to blame
Tell me who's to blame
Tell me who

[Chorus:]
I won't ever do that again
I've been all over the place
I watched the strawberry fields
Dry up and wither away
And if you ask me to stay
You know that's where I will be
Won't ever do that again
Don't wanna do that again

You call me baby blue
For all the evil schemes I pull
We sit and watch the waves break
I made a lot of mistakes
Crash collide into space

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

Aaaahooo
Aaaahooo

[Chorus]

Aaaahooo
Aaaahooo
