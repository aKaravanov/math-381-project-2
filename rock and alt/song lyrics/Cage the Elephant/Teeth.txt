Electrified harmonious
I think I'll take it out to the streets
Will somebody please help me
Call the doctor but don't call the police
Yeah, cool

Are you into the beat?
Are you into the beat?
I can feel it in my teeth

We live in an environment who’s entire population of critics and no painters to be found
Where have all the storytellers gone?
Just when did I become so eaten up by moss and covered in a cloak of popularity?
And then I lose my voice in between the echoes of self-serving prophecy
A captain without a ship, a chief… a chief without a tribe
A deranged megalomaniac who only speaks to hear his cheeks slap together and worship the sound of his own voice
A muffled cry
A muffled cry
A muffled cry
A muffled cry
Power concaved inside a woman to configure through the mythical power of the tree’s the graphics lean paper small
Paper thin garments …and garments …and garments …and garments …and garments …and garments …and garments …and garments
Pray for summer days
The rain and wind is so strong outside my window
And winter’s always searching for another
I hear his cheeks slap together and worship his own voice

(L-Louder? Okay. Alright.)

I’m so tired of the demands of this world
Her nagging voice
The song she sings, the song that she desires
She cries out in the heat of her passions
Her legs spread and ready for a-
Ready for a stranger
The captain without a ship a chief… a chief without a tribe
A raging megalomaniac who only speaks to hear his cheeks slap together and worship the sound of his own voice
I dare not take another drink until it’s gone
Just when did I become eaten up by moss and covered in a cloak of popularity
When I lose my voice in between the echoes of self-serving prophecy
