

Timber shakes these trails; they all derail
Phony, false, and frail
An empty ocean lost our way with no direction home
Golden needles, names we take in vain
Find it harder to remain
And nothing's sacred still waiting on that explanation

[Chorus:]
Right before my eyes
I saw the whole world lose control
The whole world lost control
Before my eyes uh-huh
I fell through the floor
I couldn't take it anymore
I can't take this anymore
It breaks my mind uh-huh

Hold her dirty hands over the flames
Getting pleasure from the pain
Softly screaming the pistol that you raise has spoken
Golden needles names we take in vain
Find it harder to remain
Well nothing's sacred still waiting on that explanation

[Chorus]

Everything I thought I knew fell to the side
Time went on and on I couldn't see past my own eyes
Past my eyes [x3]

[Chorus]
