But now I'm stuck here in the middle
Got this scalpel in my hand,
I'm operating on this riddle
Got my tongue on tight-knot,
On my forehead placed a label
Took all my inspiration,
Carved your name into the table

Let's talk about me
Let's talk about you
I know your type I know exactly what you wanna do
And if the money's right you think I'd just agree
So sad to see you torn apart by all this selfish greed
So sell yourself, don't be a fool
Sell yourself, take heed to fight?
You need to sell yourself, don't be a fool
Sell yourself
Sell yourself

All my memories shard lifted cut and snipped into little pieces
Chocking on your cancer waiting on the releases
No more need to operate, you already fooled the masses
Nothing left to give you, you already fooled the masses

Let's talk about me
Let's talk about you
I know your type, I know exactly what you wanna do
And it the money's right you think I'd just agree
So sad to see you torn apart by all this selfish greed
Sell yourself, don't be a fool
Sell yourself, take heed to fight?
Sell yourself, don't be a fool
Sell yourself
Sell yourself

Sell yourself [x3]
Sell yourself, don't be a fool
Sell yourself, take heed to fight
Sell yourself, don't be a fool
Sell yourself
Sell yourself
