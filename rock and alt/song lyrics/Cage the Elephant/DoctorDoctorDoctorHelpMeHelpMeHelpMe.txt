

I went in as a patient
They kept me constantly waiting
I gave my best performance
They knew that I was faking

Hey, I ain't got much else to say
No excuses I can make
Fuzzy feeling on the wall
Lord, you know I've tried them all
Now watch me rise
And fall

So warm wrapped in a blanket
Feel wholesome, almost naked
I watch my fingers tremble
No sign of hesitation

Hey, I ain't got much else to say
No excuses I can make
Fuzzy feeling on the wall
Lord, you know I've tried them all
Now watch me rise
And fall
And fall

Ain't got no problem to you
Ain't got no problem said
Oh, oh, oh no

Ain't got no problem to you
Ain't got no problem said
Oh, oh, oh no

Hey, I ain't got much else to say
No excuses I can make
Fuzzy feeling on the wall
Lord, you know I've tried them all

Lord, you know I've tried them all
Lord, you know I've tried them all
Lord, you know I've tried them all
Lord, you know I've tried them
