I just can't seem to get away from
Can you dig it?

You will never see it
No, you won't find it falling off my tongue
I take it down 'til I finally lose it

I don't think it's very nice
To walk around my head all night
You got me tangled like a bread tie twisted
I don't think it's fair
Do you? You?

Out here on the flip side
You know I took the long way round
'Cause all I really am is a homemade elevator

Blinded by your sunshine
Put you on a plane to old Paris
Lay my cards down on the table

I don't think it's very nice
To walk around my head all night
You got me tangled like a bread tie twisted
I don't think it's fair

Can't find a reason for these feelings
Clouding up above me
Cause God—he told me
Said he's gonna send me something lovely

But even still at times I wonder
What you're thinking of me
You're probably sure I lost my mind
Oh mind, oh mind, oh mind, oh mind

I don't think it's very nice
To walk around my head all night
You got me tangled like a bread tie twisted
I don't think it's fair

I don't think it's very polite
To walk around my head all night
You got me tangled like a bread tie twisted
I don't think it's fair
