

While bullets shower the earth 
We turn our heads and cover our faces 
Now flames devour the sky 
And I hear these words in the back of my Mind 

[Chorus:]
Here we stand at this fork in the road 
We got no time to waste 
Oh which way shall we go? 
This old world's spinning out of control 
Oh which way shall we go? 
Which way shall we go? 
I can't believe this, it makes me sick 

Fresh smell of death on your tongue 
You bait the hook and here come the children 
Another grave stone to sell 
While you get rich in the valley of hell 

[Chorus]

The devil's creeping 
He's got us eating from his dirty hands 
We feast on lies 
Which makes it hard for us to make a stand 
Out in the desert 
There's a forest full of fallen trees 
It's what they want 
But it's not what we need 

Screaming at the ceiling 
Doesn't make it better 
Slipped into a coma 
Lost my favorite sweater 
Ask them no more questions 
You'll never catch them lying 
It's time to make our move 
And strike them right between the eyes
