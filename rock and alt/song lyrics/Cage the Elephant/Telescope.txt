

In a far and distant galaxy
Inside my telescope I see
A pair of eyes peer back at me
He walks and talks and looks like me
Sits around inside his house
From room to room he moves about
Fills his life with pointless things
And wonders how it all turns out

It's safe to say that

I don't think you understand!
There's nowhere left to turn
Walls keep breaking
Time is like a leaf in the wind
Either it's time well-spent
Or time I've wasted

Don't waste it

Afraid of what the truth might bring
He locks his doors and never leaves
Desperately searching for signs
Too terrified to find a thing
He battens all the hatches down
And wonders why he hears no sound
Frantically searching his dreams
He wonders what it's all about

It's safe to say that

I don't think you understand!
There's nowhere left to turn
The walls keep breaking
Time is like a leaf in the wind
Either it's time well-spent
Or time I've wasted

Here in my mind
Losing my friends
Fall on my face
Do it again
You say, "How do you do?"
Man, how 'bout you?
Man, how 'bout you?
To be free
To be sold
To be killed
To be saved
In my head, I'm alone
I'm not dead, I'm ashamed
Just like you
I've been tryin' to escape
In my bones I feel cold
I give thanks to the Lord
Industry
In this street
Let me go
Let me be
I don't need to be here
I'm alone
Can't you see? Can't you see?

I don't think you understand!
There's nowhere left to turn
These walls keep breaking
Time is like a leaf in the wind
Either it's time well-spent
Or time I've wasted

Don't waste it
