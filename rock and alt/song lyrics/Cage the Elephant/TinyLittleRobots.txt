Oh my, you think you're lookin' pretty
They got a pistol too
Tucked down beneath their shoe

It's a new sensation
World annihilation
Moving to the music
Patiently it's waiting

The city's screaming
I can hear them breathing
Crying out for wisdom
Hungry minds are feeding

I know that you're tired of this
Cause you're a robot
They designed your life
True souls said you know what's right
You can join us on the other side

Are you scared?
Are you scared?
Are you scared?

I've got you marching to a drum beat
Oh my you got another nose bleed
They'll keep you so amused
You'll never taste the truth

It's a new creation
Total domination
Chains across your shoulders
Social captivation

Kill our leaders
Persecute our teachers
Criticize our culture
Crucify free thinkers

I know that you're tired of this
Cause you're a robot
They designed your life
But true souls said you know what's right
You can join us on the other side

Are you scared?
Are you scared?
Are you scared?

Fill our eyes with money
Vanity that's cunning
Only on the surface
Diamonds look so stunning

Mass deception
Altered our perception
Sold it to the children
Made a new connection

And I know that you're tired of this
Cause you're a robot
They designed your life
But true souls said you know what's right
You can join us on the other side

Our sidewalks are broken
Our minds have been twisted
The billboards are lying, the lies have been made
The streets are all empty, we paved them with zombies
A lost generation generically made
A dream that was creeping I kept in my sight
Then it turned and it took me
An explosion, it shook me
Beauty that screams, "I'm alive"
When amidst all the madness, I saw a flower
