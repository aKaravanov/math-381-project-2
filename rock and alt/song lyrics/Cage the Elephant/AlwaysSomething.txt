Rise to meet the sun
Work so hard to feed your wife
No time to show her lovin'
And in the madness of the evenin'
With diamonds in your hand
Came home an hour early
Caught her with another man

It's always somethin'
Before the late night
Around the corner
There's always somethin' waitin' for ya
Can't hold the hands back
Can't make the sun rise
It's always somethin'
You know it's always somethin'

On your way back home again
A Good Samaritan
You see a man stuck in the rain
Stranded with no friends and
From the goodness of your heart
You saved him from the flood
A couple miles down the road
He's covered in your blood

It's always somethin'
Before the late night
Around the corner
There's always somethin' waitin' for ya
Can't hold the hands back
Can't make the sun rise
It's always somethin'
You know it's always somethin'

Moving around you never see it comin'
Burned by the light you though that you were runnin'
Blinded again, you're floatin like a feather
Why can't you see you can't control the weather?

Sometimes I caught myself
Lookin' in the mirror
With my eyeballs out
And I'm lookin' at the fear
In the bottom of the drain
Saw it growin' like a plant
But it never worked out 
The way I wrote it in my hands
I tried, I tried, I tried, decide, decide, decide... 

It's always somethin'
Before the late night
Around the corner
There's always somethin' waitin' for ya

Can't hold the hands back
Can't make the sun rise
It's always somethin'
You know it's always somethin'
You know it's always somethin'
You know it's always somethin'
