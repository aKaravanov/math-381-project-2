

Heart of steel, born to kill
Mother's milk, left me dressed to shame
I just go my way
Move too fast, it won't last
Hammerhead, Daddy ran away
He still knows my name

Ooh, something's gotta give
The paper on the wall, soon will peel and fall
Ooh, and then you'll see my face, painted up with sin
Cover me, cover me again

I outgrew my old shoes
My backyard was cluttered up with lies
Kept it easy on the eyes
Fresh homemade, under shade
Black and red, paint my fingers blue
Still hiding from the truth

Mmm, my best friend kills the pain
Mmm, but only for a day
Mmm, keeps on chewing on my veins

Ooh, something's gotta give
The paper on the wall, soon will peel and fall
Ooh, then you'll see my face, painted up with sin
Cover me, cover me again
Cover me again
