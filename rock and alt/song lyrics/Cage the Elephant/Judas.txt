

The time has finally come you get a mouth full 
You only act on greed and by your actions this is proved 
And can't you see all the flowers diein all around you 
Got your hands in the devil's pockets got everything to loose 

And so you lash out 
To crush the ones below 
Or all the ones that you fear most 
And you call this crowd control 
Well let me break it down for ya 

The fire in your veins is just a joke you tell yourself 
Another way to cut the cost to hide your face from all the guilt 
And is a shame you had to say you had to kill to gain control 
But at least you made some money, hey let the good times roll 

Its your dream to be the king of all creation 
As far as im concerned you hung you shadow on the wall 
And though your fingers never really pulled the trigger 
Your hands are just as guilty your the one who brought the blood 

Again you lash out to hush the ones who know 
Cause they're the ones that you fear most 
And it's called damage control 
Well let me break it down for ya 

The fire in your veins is just a joke you tell yourself 
Another way to cut the cost to hide your face from all the guilt 
And is a shame you had to say you had to kill to gain control 
But at least you made some money, hey let the good times roll 

Oh my the greed has now consumed you 
Your eyes fade as you fell into the ocean 
You move fast to feed your lust for money 
You dive down now you're caught in the commotion 

All this and you trade it in for nothin 
A cheap lie you put it in your pocket 
All this and you trade it in for nothin 
Oh my I can see you heart has met its end
