

Well, I'm builiding a highway back, 
back to the heart of things 
? back,
back to the heart of things 

So, I'm building a ? back 
All our city gone red
When I get it all from you, 
I'm gonna get it all, true, true 

It's cold when I say goodbye 
People holding a meaning, why 
But you never let the car get in 
Howling on the sound of swim 

Did you want it? 
Well, I'm ? road 
? road 
Say what you want 
Don't bring anything back to me 
Cause I'm holding a ?
Hoping to run out of my lie 
If I get a lot from you 
I'll make it all come true
