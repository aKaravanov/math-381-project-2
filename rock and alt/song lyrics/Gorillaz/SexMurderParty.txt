[Zebra Katz & Jamie Principle:]
Yeah, see, we gone
Sex murder
Sex murder party
Sex murder party
Sex murder party
Sex murder party
Sex murder party
Sex murder party
Murder, murder, murder, murder
Murder, murder, murder, murder
Murder, murder, murder, murder
Murder, murder, murder, murder

[2D:]
I drove the kids
I drove the kids
Into tears of your priority
Disown the kids
Disown the kids
Into tears of your priority

[Jamie Principle:]
I'm caught up in this
I'm caught up in this murder
I'm trying to get away, but
I'm trapped in this phase
I'm caught up in this masquerade

[2D:]
I drove the kids
I drove the kids
Into tears of your priority
Disown the kids
Disown the kids
Into tears of your priority

[Zebra Katz:]
You always said
I was out of control
Teach me hatred
Then let me go
You didn't care, no truth and no dare
In the bathroom, blow everywhere
Now you're so high, kiss all the guys
Making me jealous, I wonder why

[2D:]
I drove the kids
I drove the kids
Into tears of your priority
Disown the kids
Disown the kids
Into tears of your priority
