A cha-charger
Everything is supposed to get in
I just don't know where I'm a-getting it from
A cha-charger
What is the cause of it?
And well in that case, how do you know it's your own?
A cha-charger
What do you say now?
Thought you could use it when the flowers have grown
A cha-charger
What did you do in it?
I bet you're racing it, I'm left in a stew, shukuchi

[2D & Pauline Black:]
(A cha-charger)
Everything is complicated
I am the river but the water is wild
(A cha-charger)
Where is my ion charge?
I move all-mooka when I'm turning it on
(A cha-charger)
Can't find him here on Earth
Let him language and let back on creation
(A cha-charger)
What is the cause of it?
It's in my M-E-E-G-magination

(A cha-charger...)
