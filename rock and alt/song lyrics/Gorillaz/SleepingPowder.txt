This is drugs
This is your brain on drugs
Any questions?

I was gone with the self of the day, gone
With the self of the day, gone
With the self of the day, gone
Gone, gone, gone
I was gone

I'm back, where are we going?
Seem to get tired of the morning dawn
With a basin on my head
I'm missin' all that I used to know, then
I get the kids to go
And I get up on with certain dread
And when I see the kissing down below
Easy life, I get right

I was gone with the self of the day, gone
With the self of the day, gone
(Yeah, I get myself upright)
With the self of the day, gone
Gone, gone, gone
I was gone

I get dropped from where I belong
I take my pills and I get in the mode
And I take five to get it to load in
Even in the place
And I get my jeans on right
And sit in the rows and
Inside, I live in a cage and I
Peek out and summon the code
And I enter the lake to face what I'm cagin'

Gone with the self of the day, gone
With the self of the day, gone
(Yeah, I get myself upright)
With the self of the day, gone
Gone, gone, gone
I was gone

She gave me sleeping powder
I was gone
Gone, gone, gone

(I was gone!)
I was gone with the self of the day, gone
With the self of the day, gone (Yeah, I get myself upright)
With the self of the day, gone
(I was gone)
Gone, gone, gone, gone
I was gone, gone, gone
I was gone
