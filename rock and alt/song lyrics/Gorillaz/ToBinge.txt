[Yukimi Nagano:]
Waiting by the mailbox, by the train
Passin' by the hills 'til I hear the name
I'm looking for a saw to cut these chains in half and all I want is
Someone to rely on as
Thunder comes a rolling down
Someone to rely on as
Lightning comes a staring in again

[Damon Albarn:]
I'll wait to be forgiven
Maybe I never will
My star has left me
To take the bitter pill
That shattered feeling
Well the 'cause of it's a lesson learned
Just don't know if I could roll into the sea again
"Just don't know if I could do it all again," she said, it's true

[Yukimi Nagano:]
Waiting in my room and I lock the door
I watch the coloured animals 'cross the floor
And I'm looking from a distance
And I'm listening to the whispers
And, oh, it ain't the same
When you're falling out of feeling
And you're ralling in and caught again
Caught again

[Damon Albarn:]
I'm caught again in the mystery
You're by my side, but are you still with me?
The answer's somewhere deep in it, I'm sorry that you're feeling it
But I just have to tell you that I love you so much these days
Have to tell you that I love you so much these days, it's true

[Damon Albarn (Yukini Nagano):]
My heart is in economy
Due to this autonomy
Rolling in and caught again
Caught again

[Both:]
Caught again
Caught again
Caught again

My heart is in economy
Due to this autonomy
Rolling in and caught again
Caught again
