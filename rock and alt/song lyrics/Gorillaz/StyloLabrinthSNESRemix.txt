[Hook - 2D:]
Oh stylo
Go forth, blossom in your soul
When you know your heart is light
Electric is the love
When the mako flies
Up from the bottom in your eyes
Then I know the twilight skies
Are not so broken hearted

(About to go down)

[2D & Labrinth:]
Stylo, stylo
Stylo, stylo
Stylo, stylo, stylo
Elec-lec, electric is the

[Hook]

[Bobby Womack:]
There's only one way
Let it pray a little while longer
It's got a way of passing through man and woman
In another world, in another world, in the universe

[Mos Def:]
Love, electricity, shockwave central
Power on the motherboard, yes!
Push up, overload, legendary heavy glow
Sunshine, thunder roll, keep this on
Yes, the lantern burn, burn that easy
And broadcast, so raw and neatly
Thunder roll, sunshine, work it out

[2D & Labrinth:]
Stylo, stylo
Stylo, stylo
Stylo, stylo, stylo
Electric, electric

[2D:]
Sing yourself
Out of depression, rise above
I'll be searching if I know your heart
Electric is the love

[Tinie Tempah:]
Yeah, uh, I'm overwhelmed, like my poem reveals
I found my love electric flow in myself
Frozen my hell, my soul's in a shell
My opponents have failed
Haters undetected like a soldier with stealth
Pray for a happy ending, play my role in the film
That's the emotion we feel
Oh Stylo, let your love shine brighter than some white dough

(Here's what we got to do)

[Mos Def:]
That's what I'm talking about
Love, electricity, shockwave central
Pummel on the motherboard, yes
Push up, overload, legendary heavy glow
Sunshine, thunder roll, keep it all together
Yes the lantern burn, burn that easy
And broadcast, so raw and neatly
Thunder roll, sunshine, work it out

[Labrinth & Tinie Tempah:]
Electric, electric
Electric, electric
(I found my love electric)
Electric, electric
Electric, electric
(I found my love electric)

Electric is all you need
So follow me to the light
(I found my love electric)
Electric is all you need
So follow me
