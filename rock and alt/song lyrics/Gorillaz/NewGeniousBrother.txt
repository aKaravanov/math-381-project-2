I live on my world
Going off my head, down to somewhere
Goin' on a dance all tune
In a pressure today
I blew a bad man away today
Had a gun, had to be done
I blew a man away

Brother, sister too
Do what you must do
Don't trust people you meet, yeah, yeah
They might promise you
That the river ain't deep

Dream on the street
People passing through me, yes, they do
Well, my friend, won't my heart mend ?
I'm gonna bring it all back

Brother, sister too
Do what you must do
Don't trust people you meet yeah
They might promise you
That the river ain't deep
Brother, sister too
Do what you must do
Don't trust people you meet yeah
They might promise you
That the river ain't deep

Brother, sister too
Do what you must do
