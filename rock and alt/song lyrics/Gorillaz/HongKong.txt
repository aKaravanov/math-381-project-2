

Lord, hear me now
Junk boats and English boys 
Crashing out in super marts 
Electric fences and guns 

You swallow me 
I'm a pill on your tongue
Here on the nineteenth floor
The neon lights make me come 

And late in a star's life 
It begins to explode 
And all the people in a dream 
Wait for the machine 
To pick the shit up, leave it clean

Kid, hang over here 
What you learning in school? 
Is the rise of an Eastern sun 
Gonna be good for everyone? 

The radio station disappears 
Music turning to thin air 
The DJ was the last to leave 
She had well-conditioned hair,
Was beautiful, but nothing really was there
