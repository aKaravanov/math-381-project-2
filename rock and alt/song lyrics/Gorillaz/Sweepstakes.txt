Pay day, you're a winner

Pay day, you're a winner
Keep cool form a line
Scared money, broke money
Bold money, more money
So sunny, cloud breaker
Sound make a wave run-up
Wild wonder, funky drummer
You can get it how you wanna

There's math and there's dealers and players and me
They say that they're winners
OK well let's see
You pay or you play
The rules of the trade
The math of the days
The times and the age
What you want? How you like?
Aim high, man, why not?
Sun, moon, and starry y'alls
Each and all of y'alls
Mathematics and dealers and players and me
They say that they're winners
OK well let's see...

Sweepstakes! You're a winner [4x]

Pay day, you're a winner
Keep cool form a line
Scared money, broke money
Bold money, more money
So sunny, cloud breaker
Sound maker, wave run-up
Wild wonder, funky drummer
You can get it how you wanna
'Who's the winner?' said the dealer
Every player 'Yeah me'
So you say 'We will see'
Player play! hey OK
What you want? How you like?
Aim high. Man, why not?
Sun Moon and starry y'alls
Each and every all of y'alls
Who's the winner? Yeah me

Cloud breaker danger beats!
Big feat
