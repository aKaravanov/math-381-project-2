

Here they come to steal my soul
(Ghost train)
Wait it out until I know
(Ghost train)
Trying not to feel like you did
(Ghost train)
Moving up until I go go-o
(Ghost train)
She was not to hear about me leaving
(Ghost train)
Trying to hear in my heart
(Ghost train)
Trying not to feel like you did
(Ghost train)
Moving up until I'm taught to your side
(Ghost train)

Yeah yeah yeah
(Ghost train)
[x4]

Got suicide for my baby
(Ghost train)
Living up until I'm wanted
(Ghost train)
Seeing like I'm not a baby
(Ghost train)
Moving up and taught I'm a weapon
(Ghost train)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
(Ghost train)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
(Ghost train)
I see myself pretend how to get there
(Ghost train)
Trippin' down a poison on the street
(Ghost train)

Come on come on come on
(Ghost train)
[x8]

(Ghost train train train...)

Got suicide for my baby
(Ghost train)
Living up until I'm wanted
(Ghost train)
Seeing like I'm not a baby
(Ghost train)
Moving up and taught I'm a weapon
(Ghost train)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
(Ghost train)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
(Ghost train)
I see myself pretend how to get there
(Ghost train)
Trippin' down a poison on the street
(Ghost train)

Come on come on come on!
(Ghost train!)
