[Anthony Hamilton:]
We play to win, just to find the dark
Go home again, and we both fall out
I wanna spend this time with you
Doing nothing
Keep you satisfied, while they rob us blind
I hear the music in the background
Singing, singing

Oh, I haven't see the glory
Coming, coming, coming
And we play
We play, we play, we play like a...

Just like a carnival
Game, just like a carnival
Laugh, just like a carnival
Joke, just like a...
Spinning me round and around and around
Just like a carnival

We play to win, just to find the dark
Go again, and we both fall out
I wanna spend this time with you
Doing nothing

We... just like a carnival
We laughed, just like a carnival
Sleep with the dead, just like a carnival
Playing with your mind, just like a...
Spinning me round and around and around
Just like a carnival, yeah

(We have to wake up...)

[2D:]
It's made up of junk
Sitting in wood
Ripe in a passport tree
Stepped in the light
Oh, then the tree came down
Seven hours more

[Anthony Hamilton:]
Play, just like a carnival
Game, just like a carnival
Laugh, just like a carnival
Joke, just like a carnival
Spinning me round and around and around
Huh? Just like a carnival, yeah
