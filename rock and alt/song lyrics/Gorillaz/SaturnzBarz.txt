[2-D (Popcaan):]
(All my life)
I'm in the stakin' bar
I got debts, I'm a debaser
(All my life)
Saturn's about to make love
And I'm just a heartbreaker
(All my life)
And I won't get a take in
'Cause I'm out when I'm stakin'
And the rings I am breaking
Are making you a personal debt

[2-D (Popcaan):]
With the holograms beside me
I'll dance alone tonight
In a mirrored world, are you beside me
All my life?
(Distortion)

(All my life)
I'm in the stakin' bar
I got debts, I'm a debaser
(All my life)
Saturnz about to make love
And I'm just a heartbreaker
(All my life)
And I won't get a take in
'Cause I'm out when I'm stakin'
And the rings I am breaking
Are making you a personal debt
