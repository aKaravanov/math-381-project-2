

I'm a scary gargoyle on a tower
That you made with plastic power
Your rhinestone eyes are like factories far away

When the paralytic dreams that we all seem to keep
Drive on engines 'til they weep
With future pixels in factories far away

So call the mainland from the beach
Your heart is now washed up in bleach
The waves are rising for this time of year
And nobody knows what to do with the heat
Under sunshine pylons we'll meet
While rain is falling like rhinestones from the sky

Uh
MmmmMMMMMMMmmmmm...

I got a feeling now my heart is frozen
All the verses and the corrosion
Have been after native in my soul
I prayed on the immovable
Yet clinging to the atoms of rocks
Seasons see adjustments signs of change
I can't see now she said, "Taxi."
Now that light is so I can see
This storm brings strange loyalties, and skies

I'm a scary gargoyle on a tower
That you made with plastic power
Your rhinestone eyes are like factories far away
(Here we go again)
(That's electric)
Uh
(That's electric)

Helicopters fly over the beach
Same time every day, same routine
A clear target in the summer, when skies are blue
It's part of the noise when winter comes
It reverberates in my lungs
Nature's corrupted in factories far away
(Here we go again)
(That's electric)

Your love's like rhinestones, falling from the sky
(That's electric)
With future pixels in factories far away
(Here we go again)
(That's electric)
Your love's like rhinestones, falling from the sky
(That's electric)
With future pixels in factories far away (Here we go again)
