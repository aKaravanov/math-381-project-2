[2-D:]
When the pulsing looks to die for
Take it in your heart now, lover
When the case is out
And tired and sodden
Take it in your heart
Take it in your heart
Take it in your heart, heart, heart, heart
Take it in your heart, heart, heart
Take it in your heart, heart, heart, heart
Take it in your heart, heart, heart, heart

[D.R.A.M.:]
Back to when it was cool

[2-D:]
Take it in your heart, heart, heart, heart
Take it in your heart, heart, heart, heart
Take it in your heart now, lover
Take it in your heart, heart, heart
Take it in your heart, heart, heart, heart
Take it in your heart, heart, heart, heart
Take it in your heart
Take it in your heart, heart, heart, heart

Outside, cold and ghosting out with jet lag
I took it to the right man
Took it all back
When the courts were closing
It was Bobby gracing
I know that
A bullet to the right man
He pulled it back

[D.R.A.M.:]
Caught in your eyes
Stacks of lights
Come streaming back
Make it for the best times
Growing pains, good times
Good times, good times (take it in your heart, heart, heart, heart)
Good times, good times
Good times, good times
Good times, good times
Good times, good times

[2-D:]
Take it in your heart, heart, heart, heart
Take it in your heart now, lover
Take it in your heart
Take it in your heart, heart, heart
Heart, heart, heart, heart
Take it in your heart now, lover
Heart, heart, heart, heart
Take it in your heart now, lover
Take it in your heart
Take it in your heart, heart, heart

[2-D & D.R.A.M.:]
Where it all went down
Where it all went down
