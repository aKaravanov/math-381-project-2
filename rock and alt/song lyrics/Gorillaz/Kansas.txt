I've got more time to give
I'm not gonna cry
I'll find another dream

Am I incapable of healing?
The memory of my fall from grace in your heart
I'm on my journey home
With no fuel, alone
I think I'll coast awhile

I'm not gonna cry
I've got more time to give
I'm not gonna cry
Find another dream

'Cause I'm about to solve it
Put my engine back in to overdrive
So I can breath again
Photosynthesize again
With the green hills of my home

I'm not gonna cry
I've got more time to give
I'm not gonna cry
Find another dream

I'm not gonna cry
(Say the way to me)
I've got more time to give
(It's getting nasty)
I'm not gonna cry
Find another dream

But if I got it right, you'd tell me
And if I was wrong, then I disappear
But I'm incapable

I'm not gonna cry
(Say the way to me)
I've got more time to give
(It's getting nasty)
I'm not gonna cry
Find another dream
