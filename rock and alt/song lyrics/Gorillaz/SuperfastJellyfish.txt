This morning you've got time for a hot home-cooked breakfast.
Delicious and piping hot in only 3 microwave minutes.

Are you kidding?

[Dave:]
Yo, pretty packages of frosted delights.

—Look, it comes with a toy he he, I like that. I wanna number 4, a number 6, and throw in a plastic dough-nut.

Just enjoy the gritty crunch, that tastes just like chicken.
Wrappers of many bite sizes.

—Man, are you freaking blind? That's a rock.

All mixed in the potful.
Momma's homemade from scratch, well, not quite.
Toasted over flames, they be tasting quite right.

[Posdnuos and (Dave):]
All hail King Neptune and his water-breathers.
No snail thing too quick for his water-feeders.
Don't waste time with your net.
Our net worth is set.
Ready, go.
Many know others, what?

We be the colors of the mad
And the wicked.
We be bad,
We re-brick it
With the 24-hour sign.
Shower my habits
While you dine like rabbits.
With the crunchy, crunchy carrots.

—Oh, that's chicken.

Gotta have it super fast!

—A whole lot of breakfast you got time for!

[Gruff Rhys:]
Super fast, super fast.
I come in last,
But just in time for breakfast.
Keep us through, keep us through,
Forever blue.
The night, the night throws at us.
Aluminum, I crush your fun.
Aluminum.
The sea is radioactive.
The sea is radioactive.

[2D:]
Super fast, super fast.
I come in last,
But just in time for breakfast.
Keep us through, keep us through,
Forever blue.
Tonight the night throws at us.
Aluminum, I crush your fun.
Aluminum.
The sea is radioactive.
The sea is radioactive.

[2D and (Posdnuos):]
Superfast jellyfish.
Superfast jellyfish.
Superfast jellyfish.
Superfast jellyfish.

—Don't waste time!

Superfast jellyfish.
Superfast jellyfish.
Superfast jellyfish.

—A sea has gone green. What?

Everybody loves jellyfish! [4x]
Superfast jellyfish. [repeat until the end]
