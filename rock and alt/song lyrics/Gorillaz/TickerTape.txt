[2D:]
Is it resolution?
Or black and white flying balloons?
Floating off, too colourful
Or is it separation
You put it to your counting sand
Waiting for the world to start again?

Ticker tape
Ticker tape
Tick-tick-ticker tape

Is this how you're feeling?
Falling with the world tonight
Cauterized and beautiful
Slide the light
Is this how you're healing?
Out there in the paradigm
Waiting for a cavalcade to come again

Ticker tape
Ticker tape
Tick-tick-ticker tape
Ticker tape

[Carly Simon & 2D:]
Black light glints with colour
Sudden long and horizontal outlines the star
A sudden draft and quick chill
A single snowflake falls
And that is all
That is all
The world's face hidden under falling wind
Waiting for the world to start again
Waiting for the world to start again
Waiting for the world to start again
Waiting for the world... again

[Kali Uchis (2D):]
'Cause we're working through it
Working through your nightmare
(Are you leaving for the rest of it?)
Watch the worker bees
As they're working for it
Working through the night shift
And I'm working through it
Working through the nightmare
(Coming back to ghosts inside)
Watch the worker bees
As they're working for it
Working through the night shift	
(Or is it just too late for that?)

'Cause we're working through it
Working through your nightmare
Watch the worker bees
As they're working for it
Working through the night shift
And I'm working through it
Working through the nightmare
(And I'm hoping for a little juice)
Watch the worker bees
As they're working for it
Working through the night shift
