If you dream to the top
You'll be over the edge
If you get it on side
You'll be taking a ditch
You'll be loving our love
But you don't know why
It's the term of the day
So we never excite
If your heart isn't there
So you might as well say
"I know it, I got it but I know that time will set me together"
