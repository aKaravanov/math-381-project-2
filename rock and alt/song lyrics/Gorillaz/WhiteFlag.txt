[Bashy:]
Hey, look, yo!
No castaway, no survivor
I ain't lost and this ain't shipwrecked
I feel small in this big wide world
And mommy ain't said 'Honey, I shrunk the kids' yet.
I ain't Jesus, but I'm walkin' on water.
There's no bombs here, there's no war
'Cause I can break out of jail with a lighter,
So is there any point in makin' laws blood?
This ain't Atlantis, are you sure?
I nearly suffocated when I touched the shore
No rain, condoms it poured
And up the road, you'd never guess who I saw

[Kano (Bashy):]
Uh, uh, uh, it's K-A
Look: skip on the beat like Ali in the gym (yeah)
Honey, I'm home this is where I wanna live (yeah)
Just found it like Nemo
On the D-low.
I don't know if it's greener
But it's green though
On the other side of the fence.
Bye to the ends.
Look: no feds, no stress, no rent, no superficial shit,
This real flow.
Where the women look hot, but the beach cold,
And the speech goes like, "Hi, little lady."
Sex on the beach, wanna try for a baby.
Word in the village, I'm a little bit crazy.
Swag up on a hundred degrees, no A/C.
Look: if heaven had a VIP
Uh, this is it: white sand, blue sea,
But I don't know who they are,
And I'm damn sure they don't know me,
But I come in peace!

[Bashy (Kano):]
Cool! White flag! White flag!
(Aha, no war!)
No guns (No corps!)
Just life.
(Just love) no hype.
(Just fun) no ties.
(Just me and my mind)
Just me and my wife.
(But tell me if I'm dreamin'
'Cause I don't wanna wake up 'til the evenin')
And I don't wanna be left sleepin'
From all the diseases that I breathe in.
(Look, respect the island, no stealin')
And don't bring religion here, no three kings.
(Integrate and then we ain't leavin'
We come on a peace. Sing!)
White flag?
(White flag!)
