[Benjamin Clementine:]
Here is our tree
That primitively grows
And when you go to bed
Scarecrows from the far east
Come to eat
Its tender fruits
And I thought the best way to perfect our tree
Is by building walls
Walls like unicorns
In full glory
And galore
And even stronger
Than the walls of Jericho
But glad then my friend
Out in the field we shall reap a better day
What we have always dreamt of having
Are now for the starving
It is love, that is the root of all evil
But not our tree
And thank you my friend
For trusting me

[Benjamin Clementine (Choir):]
Hallelujah
(Hallelujah)
Hallelujah money
(Past the chemtrails)
Hallelujah money...

[2D:]
How will we know?
When the morning comes
We are still human
How will we know?
How will we dream?
How will we love?
How will we know?

[Benjamin Clementine:]
Don't worry, my friend
If this be the end, then so shall it be
Until we say so, nothing will move
Ah, don't worry
It's not against our morals
It's legally tender
Touch my friend
While the whole world
And whole beasts of nations desire
Power

[2D:]
When the morning comes
We are still human
How will we know?
How will we dream?
How will we love?
How will we know?

[Benjamin Clementine (Choir):]
(Hallelujah money)
Hallelujah money
(Past the chemtrails)
Hallelujah money...
