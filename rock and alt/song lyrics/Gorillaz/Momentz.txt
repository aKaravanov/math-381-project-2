[De La Soul:]
Clocks on the wall
Talk to watches on the wrist
It's the moments we relive
It's the moments like this
When it's time to get ill
We be so ahead of time
It's the moments we achieve
Best believe it's the moments

[2D:]
Main event, yellow, red, black, white
Dirty
(Moments)
Main event, yellow, red, black, white
Dirty
(Moments)
Shivers down my backbone

[De La Soul:]
De La is also back again
With a crew that's bound to pack them in
Got a girl who's up for the mating
I sense the need in her grandma
Her nose has never been skating
But she's sippin' star constellation
The real squirt game was so like 2Pac at a court run towards camera
Her response to that was just "Check please"
Fuck that my man you can't let these (moments)
Pass you by like "tick tock"
I'm smackin' the bottom like flip flops
Made her alarm ring
(She screamed)
And now we done, we passed the test
So now lay down to rest
And wait for the morning hangover that comes

Clocks on the wall
Talk to watches on the wrist
It's the moments we relive
It's the moments like this
When it's time to get ill
We be so ahead of time
It's the moments we achieve
Best believe it's the moments

Main event, yellow, red, black, white

Main event, yellow, red, black, white
Dirty

Shivers down my backbone

[Noodle:]
Plastic on the ceiling
Plastic on the ceiling
Plastic on the ceiling
Plastic on the ceiling
Plastic on the ceiling
Plastic on the ceiling
Plastic on the ceiling
Plastic on the ceiling

[De La Soul:]
So now lay down to rest
And wait for the morning hangover that comes

Clocks on the wall
Talk to watches on the wrist
It's the moments we relive
It's the moments like this
When it's time to get ill
We be so ahead of time
It's the moments we achieve
Best believe it's the moments
Moments
Moments
Moments
Moments

I'm talkin' about the Kool Klown Klan
Kool Klown Klan
I'm talkin' about the Kool Klown Klan
I need to step out for a fresh of breath air after that
