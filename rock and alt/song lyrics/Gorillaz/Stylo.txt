[Mos Def:]
Love electricity shockwave central
Power on the motherboard, yes
Push up, overload, legendary heavy glow
Sunshine, thunder roll, keep this on
Yes the lantern burns firm and easy
And broadcast so raw and neatly
Thunder roll, sunshine, work it out

[2D:]
Overload, overload, overload
Comin' on to the
Overload, overload, overload
Comin' on to the
Overload, overload, overload
Comin' on to the
Overload, overload, overload
Comin' on to the

Oh Stylo... (juice)
Go for blossom in your soul
When you know your heart is light
Electric is the love
When the mako flies (a giant fish)
Up from the bottom in your eyes
Then I'll know the twilight skies
Are not so broken hearted (from the end of the line)

[Bobby:]
If it's love, it's electric
It'll be flowing on the streets
Night after night
Just to get through the week
Sometimes it's hard
Right now

[2D:]
Sing yourself (juice)
Out of depression, rise above all recession
If I know your heart
Electric is the love

[Bobby:]
There's only one way
Let it play a little while longer
It's got a way of passing through man and woman
In another world
In another world, in a universe
Right now
Here's what we've got to do
If it's love, it's electric
It'll be flowing on the streets
Night after night
Just to get through the week
Sometimes it's hard

[Mos Def:]
That's what I'm talking about
Love, electricity, shockwave central
Power on the motherboard, yes
Push up, overload, legendary heavy glow
Sunshine, thunder roll, keep this on
Yes the lantern burns firm and easy
And broadcast so raw and neatly
Thunder roll, sunshine, work it out

[Bobby:]
Right now
