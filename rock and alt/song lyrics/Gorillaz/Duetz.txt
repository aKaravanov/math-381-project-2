Sleeping in a co-op window
Duetz
Duetz

Washed away
(Let me get washed away)
Washed away
(Let me get washed away)

No, no, no, it's nothing new
To force a light above yourself in costume
'Cause you might not ever make it if you look like that
Get by same roads in costume

(Let me get washed away)
(Let me get washed away)
(Let me get washed away)
