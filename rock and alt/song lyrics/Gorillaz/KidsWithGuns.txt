Taking over, but it won't be long
They're mesmerized skeletons

Kids with guns, kids with guns
Easy does it, easy does it
They got something to say mental

Drinking out (push it, push it, real, push it)
Pacifier (push it, push it, real, push it)
Vitamin souls (push it, push it, real, push it)
The street desire (push it, push it, real, push it)

Doesn't make sense to (push it, push it, real, push it)
But it won't be long (push it, push it, real, push it)

Kids with guns, kids with guns
Easy does it, easy does it
They got something to say mental

And they're turning us into monsters
Turning us into fire
Turning us into monsters
It's all desire, it's all desire, it's all desire

Drinking out, pacifier
Sinking soul, there you are
Doesn't make side to, but it won't be long

'Cause kids with guns, kids with guns
Easy does it, easy does it
They got something to say mental

And they're turning us into monsters
Turning us into fire
Turning us into monsters
It's all desire, it's all desire, it's all desire

Push it, push it, real, push it, real
Push it, push it, push it, real, push it, real
Push it, push it, push it, real, push it, real
Push it, push it, push it, real, push it, real
Push it, push it, push it, real, push it, real
Push it, push it, push it, real, push it, real
Push it, push it, push it, real, push it, real
Push it, push it, real
