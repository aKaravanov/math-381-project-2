Oh yeah!
Its the music that we choose [x4]

The world is spinning too fast
I'm buying lead Nike shoes
To keep myself tethered
To the days I try to lose

My mama said to slow down
You must make your own shoes
Stop dancing to the music
Of Gorillaz in a happy mood

Keep a mild groove on

Day do, dah bop [x4]

There you go!
Get the cool!
na na na na na na na
Get the cool shoeshine! [x4]

There's a monkey in the jungle
Watching a vapour trail
Caught up in the conflict
Between his brain and his tail

And if time's elimination
Then we got nothing to lose
Please repeat the message
It's the music that we choose

Keepin, my groove on

Day do, dah bop [x4]

There you go!
Get the cool!
na na na na na na na
Get the cool shoeshine! [x4]
