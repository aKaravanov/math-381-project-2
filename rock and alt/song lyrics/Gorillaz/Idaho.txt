

I landed on the silver lake
Washed up and feeling blue
Heard the sound of footsteps
Drifting softly to the Moon

Looking for clear water
I had to take control
Out there in wilderness
Another bullet hole

Playing it all for gods
Yesterday

Idaho, Idaho
There's a beauty on the road
And everyday I look out on the bus
At silver linings getting lost

Floated out into the woods
To hear the old elk call
Touched the rainbow with my hands
On dry I got 'em all

"Ride on," said the king of cool
You've got nothing to lose
Tinsel town is down the road
It's the bullet or the noose

If you're playing it all for gods
Far away

Idaho, Idaho
There's a beauty on the road
And everyday I look out on the bus
At silver linings getting lost
