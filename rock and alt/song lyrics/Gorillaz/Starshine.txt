Starshine, they ain't gonna find me
Starshine, when you gonna find me?
Starshine never gonna find me

Stand easy with myself, oh, with myself
Jumping up, I'm low, low, low, low
Show me down

Starshine, when you gonna find me?
Starshine, they ain't gonna find me
Starshine, when you gonna find me?
Starshine, never gonna find me
