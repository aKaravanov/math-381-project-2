[Vince Staples:]
You are now tuned into the tomb of Jehova
Play my tunes loud enough to shake the room, what's the hold up?
Heard the world is ending soon I assumed that they told ya
They tryna dinosaur us
So now it's time to go up

The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash
The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash
The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash
The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash
(Drop that)

Shake the room (room, room)
Shake the room (room, room)
Shake the room (room, room)
Shake the room (room, room)

[Vince Staples:]
The roof is on fire
She wet like Barbra Streisand
Police everywhere
It's like a nigga killed a white man
I just wanna find a baby mama 'fore the night end
So don't be coming 'round Vince
On that batter ram shit

The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash
The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash
The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash
The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash

Drop that
Drop that
Drop that
Shake the room (room, room)
Shake the room (room, room)
Shake the room (room, room)
Shake the room (room, room)
The roof is on fire
