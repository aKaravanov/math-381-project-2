[Anthony Hamilton:]
We play to win, just to find the dark
Go home again, and we both fall out
I wanna spend the time with you
Doing nothing
Keep you satisfied, while they rob us blind
I hear the music in the background
Singing, singing

Oh, I haven't see the glory
Coming, coming coming
And we play
We play, we play, we play like a..

Just like a carnival
Game (Just like a carnival)
Laugh (Just like a carnival)
Joke (Just like a..)
Spinning me round and around and around
Just like a carnival

We play to win, just to find the dark
Go... again, and we both fall out
I wanna spend the time with you
Doing nothing

We... (Just like a carnival)
We laughed (Just like a carnival)
Sleep with the dead (Just like a carnival)
Playing with your mind (Just like a..)
Spinning me round and around and around
Just like a carnival, yeah...
