

Every sound
Every sound from every world receiving
Every world receiving you

Anyone
Not anyone of us who isn't searching
Everyone's receiving you

Come by the low lake
Deep in the summer day, I'll be there with you
That's where I heard it for myself
On the training ground for the new world you heard it too
