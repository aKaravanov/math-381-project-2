Yo, little ma witch in a hole in my vibe, me pause in a magic world miralizing mo', come on!
They hope the dog made mo' magic blood, London man go inside you, ah!
Jungle by jungle, jumping on to beat em' up, come to ring and sing in ma sign mo'
Pop pop, judging the fucking greed mo, that's what the oath is speaking of, ah!
Ellen pools who'll floating catchin' more, [growl] no, I'll speakin' and catchin' more
In green days girls want me scatchin' more, red pool's girls yo scatchin' more, ah!
Which boy is off the crew? Which of 'em's common and respects you?
Hold 'em boy, mus' i-ah-oh lemme' decapite a boy turntable a knife
Which boy is off the "cleigh-cleigh", if a boy could decide my gal-gal fixed kick-kick
Hold 'em boy-boy, fixed kick-kick [growl]
