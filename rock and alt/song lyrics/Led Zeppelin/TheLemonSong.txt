I wouldn't be here, my children, down on this killin' floor

I should have listened, baby, to my second mind [2x]
Every time I go away and leave you, darling,
You send me the blues way down the line

Baby, yeah, treat me right, baby
My, my, my, my
I take it down little bit
Give it to me baby keep me satisfied
Tryna worry 'bout me, baby
But I'd never get you with myself
Keep on worrying baby,
Can't keep you satisfied
Let me tell you baby
You ain't nothing but a two-bit, no-good jive

I went to sleep last night,
I worked as hard as I can
I bring home my money,
You take my money, give it to another man

I should have quit you baby,
Oh such a long time ago
I wouldn't be here with all my troubles,
Down on this killing floor

Squeeze me baby,
'Til the juice runs down my leg, oh
Please, squeeze me baby,
Until the juice runs down my leg
The way you squeeze my lemon
I'm gonna fall right out of bed, bed, bed, babe yeah

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Hey, babe, babe, babe, babe

I'm gonna leave my children down on this killing floor
