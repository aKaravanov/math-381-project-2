

With a purple umbrella and a fifty cent hat,
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman.
Missus cool rides out in her aged Cadillac.
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman.

Come on, babe on the round-about,
Ride on the merry-go-round,
We all know what your name is,
So you better lay your money down.

Alimony, alimony payin' your bills,
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman.
When your conscience hits, you knock it back with pills.
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman.

Come on, babe on the round-about,
Ride on the merry-go-round,
We all know what your name is,
So you better lay your money down.

Tellin' tall tales of how it used to be.
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman.
With the butler and the maid and the servantry
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman.

Nobody hears a single word you say.
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman.
But you keep on talkin' 'til your dyin' day.
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman.

Come on, babe on the round-about,
Ride on the merry-go-round,
We all know what your name is,
So you better lay your money down.

Livin', lovin', she's just a woman.
Living, living, loving, loving, she's just a woman.
Li-li-li-li-li-living, loving-love-love, she's just a woman.
