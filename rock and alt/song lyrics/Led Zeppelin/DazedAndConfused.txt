Wanted a woman, never bargained for you.
Lots of people talkin', few of them know
Soul of a woman was created below, yeah.

You hurt and abuse tellin' all of your lies.
Run 'round sweet baby, Lord how they hypnotize.
Sweet little baby, I don't know where you've been.
Gonna love you baby, here I come again.

Ev'ry day I work so hard bringin' home my hard-earned pay.
Try to love you baby, but you push me away.
Don't know where you're goin', I don't know just where you've been;
Sweet little baby, I want you again.

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
Oh, yeah! Alright!
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
Oh don't leave me so confused, no! Oh, baby!

Been dazed and confused for so long, it's not true,
Wanted a woman never bargained for you.
Take it easy baby, let them say what they will.
(Will your) tongue wag so much when I send you the bill?

Ooh, yeah! Alright!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
