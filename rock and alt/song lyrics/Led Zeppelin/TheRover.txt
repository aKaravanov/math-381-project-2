Seen seven wonders
I know to trip is just to fall
I used to rock it
Sometimes I'd roll it
I always knew what it was for

There can be no denyin'
That the wind'll shake 'em down
And the flat world's flying
And there's a new plague on the land

Just join hands
We could just join hands
If we could just join hands

Traversed the planet
When heaven sent me
I saw the kings who rule them all
Still by the firelight
And purple moonlight
I hear the rested rivers call

And the wind is crying
From a love that won't grow cold
My lover she is lying
On the dark side of the globe

Just join hands
We could just join hands
If we could just join hands

You got me rockin' when I ought to be a-rollin' darlin'
Tell me, darlin', which way to go
You keep me rockin' baby, then you keep me stolen
Won't you tell me darlin', which way to go
That's right

Oh how I wonder
Oh how I worry
And I would dearly like to know
I've all this wonder
Of earthly plunder
Will it leave us anything to show

And our time is flyin'
See the candle burning low
Is the new world rising
From the shambles of the old?

If we could just join hands
If we could just join hands
If we could just, if we could just, if we could just
If we could just, if we could just join hands
That's all it takes, that's all it takes
That's all it takes, that's all it takes
