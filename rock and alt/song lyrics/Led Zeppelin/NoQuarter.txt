No, they won't be home tonight. 

The snow falls hard and don't you know? 
The winds of Thor are blowing cold. 

They're wearing steel that's bright and true.
They carry news that must get through.

They choose the path where no-one goes. 

They hold no quarter. 
They hold no quarter.

Walking side by side with death,
The devil mocks their every step 

The snow drives back the foot that's slow.
The dogs of doom are howling more.

They carry news that must get through
To build a dream for me and you.

They choose the path where no-one goes. 

They hold no quarter.
They ask no quarter. 
They hold no quarter.
They ask no quarter. 

The pain, the pain without quarter. 
They ask no quarter. 
Without quarter, quarter, quarter. 
They give no quarter. 
The dogs of doom are howling more!
They give no quarter. 

I hear the dogs of doom are howling more!
