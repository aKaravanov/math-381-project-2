

In my time of dying, want nobody to mourn
All I want for you to do is take my body home

Well, well, well, so I can die easy 
Well, well, well, so I can die easy 

Jesus, gotta make up
You know
Jesus, gotta make up
Jesus, gonna make it my dyin' bed

Meet me, Jesus, meet me
Meet me in the middle of the air
If my wings should fail me, Lord
Oh, please meet me with another pair

Well, well, well, so I can die easy 
Well, well, well, so I can die easy 

Jesus, gonna make up
Somebody, somebody
Jesus gonna make up
Jesus gonna make it my dyin' bed

Oh, Saint Peter, at the gates of heaven
Won't you let me in
I never did no harm
I never did no wrong

Oh, Gabriel, let me blow your horn
Let me blow your horn
Oh, I never did, did no harm, did no harm

I've only been this young once
I never thought I'd do anybody no wrong
No, not once

Oh, I did somebody some good
Somebody some good

Oh, did somebody some good
I must have did somebody some good
Oh, I believe I did

I see the smiling faces
I know I must have left some traces

And I see them in the streets
And I see them in the field
And I hear them shouting under my feet
And I know it's got to be real

Oh, Lord, deliver me
All the wrong I've done
Oh, you can deliver me, Lord
I only wanted to have some fun

Oh, hear the angels marchin', hear the marchin', hear them marchin', hear them marchin', the' marchin'

Oh my Jesus [repeat]

I know got my Jesus
It's got to be my Jesus
It's got to be 
It's got to be my Jesus
It's got to be 
It's got to be my Jesus
Take me home

Come on, come on
I can hear the angels singing
Oh here they come, here they come, here they come

Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Oh, feels pretty good up here
Pretty good up here
Oh, Georgina
Oh, Georgina
Oh, Georgina
Oh, Georgina

Ooh let's see it again
Come on
Take [repeat]
Oh, yes, come on

Oh, don't you make it my dyin', dyin', dyin' cough

That's gonna be the one, isn't it?
Come have a listen, then
Oh, yes, thank you
