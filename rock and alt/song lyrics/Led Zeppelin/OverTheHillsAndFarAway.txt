Maybe more than enough.
Oh, darling, darling, darling, walk a while with me
You've got so much, so much, so much.

Many have I loved
Many times been bitten
Many times I've gazed
Along the open road.

Many times I've lied
Many times I've listened
Many times I've wondered
How much there is to know.

Many dreams come true
And some have silver linings
I live for my dream
And a pocketful of gold.

Mellow is a man
Who knows what he's been missing
Many many men
Can't see the open road.

Many is a word
That only leaves you guessing
Guessing 'bout a thing
You really ought to know.
Really ought to know.
I really ought to know.

You know I should.
You know I should.
You know I should.
