Look at this chain of sorrows
Stretching all the way from here and now to hell and gone
I was Kid Clean
She was Anne de Siecle
Just a thrill away from punching through to the cosmic wow
It started out good
Then it got lots better
Makin' up the rules as we went along
But with a business like this
There's an gnarly downside

[Chorus:]
I'm way deep into nothing special
Riding the crest of a wave breaking just west of Hollywood

Swingin' so hard
We burned right through the summer
Till the axis of pain/pleasure sheared the arc of desire
From the Rebus affair
To the streets of Culver City
Places and events slip below the horizon line
Now at this time
Into our pretty story
The truth compels us
To bring a certain name
Meet if you will
Doctor Warren Kruger

[Chorus]

She reached out for my hand
While I watched myself lurch across the room
And I almost got there

Look in my eyes
Can't you see the core is frozen?
You can't ask me to access the dreams I don't have now
Sadly for us
Our little talk is over
So together we'll endure the tyranny of the disallowed
Don't you love Port Blanc
When Hooterie is over
When the girls get easy and the crowds are gone
A weekend of bliss
Then the rainy season

[Chorus]
