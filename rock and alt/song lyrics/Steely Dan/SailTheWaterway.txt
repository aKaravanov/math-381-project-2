He been around the world
And he tells me everything
He told me how to tie a sailor's knot
And made me how to swim
And though my man and I got it together
He still knows what to do

He say come on and sail the waterway
It feels so good on you
Come on and sail the waterway
It feels so good on you

You can tell me you're a man of means
And I wouldn't believe it's true
Today I seen you selling door to door
And I know it makes you blue

Well you're bettin' your dollar on the wind and rain
When you put your money down

I say come on and sail the waterway
and turn your head around
come on and sail the waterway
and turn your head around

You know the tide is high
And the westward wind won't quit ya
And you know what you got to do
Cause the time is right
And the tide will wait for you

Well if you're tired of the race and the runners
And the things they make you do

I say come on and sail the waterway
Come on and sail the waterway
Come on and sail the waterway
It feels so good on you

You know the tide is high
And the westward wind won't quit ya
Well you know what you got to do
Cause the time is right
And the tide will wait for you

Come on and sail the waterway with me...
