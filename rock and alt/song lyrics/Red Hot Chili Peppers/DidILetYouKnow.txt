

C'mon c'mon

[Verse 1:]
I'm comin' for ya 
'Cause I adore ya
I'd like to get inside 
Your mass production
This indecision 
Has got me cringing 
I can't resist the smell 
Of your seduction
Did I let you know
Would you like to go
Unwrap the package 
Without much persuasion
Did I let you know
Would you like to go
I wanna dance to 
Everyday's occasion

[Chorus:]
This I know
This I know
(Take me home, well take me home)
This I know 
We're not alone
(Take me home, take me home)

[Verse 2:]
When we envision
Lack of division 
The planet does 
Another revolution
The day I blew on ya 
You said I grew on ya
Turns out that we are 
All the one solution
GO!

[Trumpet Solo]

I'm comin' at you 
Year of the cat too 
I like the sound of 
Your articulations
Want to arouse her 
And maybe espouse her 
She showed me love 
Without the stipulations

[Chorus]

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3:]
I want to lean on you
Get Jan and Dean on ya
Time to sway 
A little mass perception
I like you cheeky 
Oh so Mozambiquey
I think the world could use 
A clear connection

[Chorus x2]

Did I let you know
Would you like to go
Did I let you know
Would you like to go
Did I let you know
Would you like to go
