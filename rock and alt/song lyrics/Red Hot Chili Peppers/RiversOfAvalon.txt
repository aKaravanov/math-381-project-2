Far away where no one goes, now
Take my place in golden space
Of TV star that no one knows, now
Deep, deep mystery is talking to me
She's a giver of constant animation
All around and ready to make a new formation
You're the reason I'm in this world

I don't believe in everything I see
Rivers Of Avalon
Your supernatural energy
Part of my scenery
What I belong to is your ecstasy
Rivers Of Avalon
Your faith unwavering is key

The clone of my own loneliness has got to fade
What am I known to?
Little garland and in your starling
Loving waves that I've succumbed to
Deep, deep mystery is talking to me
She's a giver of constant adulation
All around and ready to make a new formation
You're the reason I'm in this world

I don't believe in everything I see
Rivers Of Avalon
Your supernatural enegy
Part of my scenery
What I belong to is your ecstasy
Rivers Of Avalon
Your faith unwavering is key
What do you see in me?

Deep, deep mystery is talking to me
She's a giver of constant animation
All around and ready to make a new formation
You're the reason I'm in this world

I don't believe in everything I see
Rivers Of Avalon
Your supernatural enegy
Part of my scenery
What I belong to is your ecstasy
Rivers Of Avalon
Your fathom wavering is key

I don't believe in everything I see
Rivers Of Avalon
Your supernatural enegy
All that it means
