Watching us in your garage
Big girl you ate the neighbor
The nova is over
Wake up and play
By the radio
Make room for Clara's bare feet
The love of a martian

Tick tock and waiting for the meteor
This clock is opening another door

Lots of love just keep it comin'
Making something out of nothin'
These are the best that I
I don't know how to say
Losin' what I love today
These are the best that I
Lots of love just keep it comin'
Making something out of nothin'
These are the best that I
I don't know what to say
Look at what I lost today
And these are the things that I

Blood flowers in the kitchen
Signing off and winding down
This martian ends her mission
The nova is over
She caught the ball
By the mission bell
Chase lizards bark at donkeys
The love of a martian

Let's bow our heads
And let the trumpets blow
Our girl is gone
God bless her little soul

(She's got sword in case
Tho this is not her lord in case
The one who can't afford to face
Her image is restored to grace.

Disappeared.
No trace.
Musky tears.
Suitcase.

The down turn brave
Little burn cub bear careless turnip snare
Rampages pitch color pages...
Down and out but not in Vegas.
Disembarks and disengages.
No loft.

Sweet pink canary cages plummet pop dew skin fortitude
For the sniffing black noses that snort and allude
To dangling trinkets that mimic the dirt cough go drink its.
It's for you.

Blue battered naval town slip kisses delivered by duck
Muscles and bottle-nosed grifters arrive in time to catch the late show.
It's a beehive barrel race.
A she hive stare and chase wasted feature who tried and failed to reach her.
Embossed beneath a box in the closet that's lost.
The kind that you find when you mind your own business.
Shiv sister to the quickness before it blisters into the new morning milk blanket.
Your ilk is funny to the turnstile touch bunny whose bouquet set a course for bloom without decay.
Get your broom and sweep the echoes of yesternights fallen freckles... away...)
