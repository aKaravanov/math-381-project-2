Junior pimp at old cafe
Got to change those girls around
Westbound, drunk with lots to say
But he never makes a sound

Hustlers get what they deserve
but it's always half the gate
Good things come to those who wait
Like an expiration date

[Chorus:]
See you around
I'll see you around
I'll play all night
Can't get uptight
I lead all your mind games astray
Well I'll see you around
I'll see you around
I'll play all night
Can't get uptight
See you, so long, goodbye, hooray

Curb your tongue oh scallywag
Because you've got no flag to wave
Save your breath for the black and white
Every dog will have his day

[Chorus:]
See you around
I'll see you around
I'll play all night
Can't get uptight
I lead all your mind games astray
Well I'll see you around
I'll see you around
I'll play all night
Can't get uptight
See you, so long, goodbye, hooray

Well I'll see you around, I'll see you around

[Bass Solo]

Aw yeah
Aw yeah
Aw yeah

[Chorus:]
See you around
I'll see you around
I'll play all night
Can't get uptight
I lead all your mind games astray
Well I'll see you around
I'll see you around
I'll play all night
Can't get uptight
See you, so long, goodbye, hooray

I'll see you around 
I'll see you around
I'll see you around
I'll see you around
I'll see you around
Goodbye and hooray

Well I'll see you around, I'll see you around oh nah nah no!
