I'm a rockin popstar with a get up and go
Rubbin' elbows with the big wigs at my sold out shows
I've been on every cover even rolling stone

Put us on mtv
All we really need
Begging on our knees
Please, please, please, please, please

Conforming to the norm straight out of the mold
Compromising each and every ounce of soul
I'm a doin' anything for the records of gold
I only want what i can hold

Put us on mtv
All we really need
Begging on our knees
Please, please, please, please, please

We know that we'll never be better than
Mister slick superstar david letterman
I promise we'll be perfect gentlemen
Just put us on the show you'll regret us then

Put us on mtv
All we really need
Begging on our knees
Please, please, please, please, please

Thank you very much be sure to label us
We wouldn't want to cause a ruckus or a fuss
Aor, chr, top forty or bust

Put us on mtv
All we really need
Begging on our knees
Please, please, please, please, please

What i am is a picture on the tv screen
Don't make waves don't make a scene
What i say when i play isn't worth a bean
I'm a video joe in an industry

Put us on mtv
All we really need
Begging on our knees
Please, please, please, please, please
