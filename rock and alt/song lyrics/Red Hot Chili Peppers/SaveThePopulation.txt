History's so strong
History's so strong
History's so strong

Thinking of a drinking song the honkytonk will do
Making another breaking bone your favorite ingenue
This the distant dawn
This the distant dawn

I put my cards upon the table
I do the speakers 'cause I am able
One picks is broken-down devotion
I threw my pistol in the ocean
Eyes wide with revelation
Chime at the police station
And when the verdict comes round
I'm sure that you will go down

[Chorus:]
Stay all night
we save the population
Stay all night
we save the population
Stay all night
we save the population
Stay all night
we save the population

[Instrumental Bridge]

Pistol end its fawn
Sell it to the lexicon
A pistol landed hard
Lot on bottom lines be drawn

Take another bottle down to proper lam the shrew
Make another awful sound to rap the gothic through
History's so strong
History's so strong

I put my cards upon the table
I do the speakers 'cause I am able
One picks is broken-down devotion
I threw my pistol in the ocean
Eyes wide with revelation
Chime at the police station
And when the verdict comes round
I'm sure that you will go down

[Chorus X4]
