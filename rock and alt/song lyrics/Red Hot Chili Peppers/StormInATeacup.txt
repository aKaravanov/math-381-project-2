We've got a cataclismic situation developing someone get down here now!!...)

Come on come on baby let me show you what I'm talkin' about
You try to be a lady but you're walking like a sour kraut
Looka looka lika lika like you wanna get some
If you never tell a lie then you never have to play dumb

Dirty baby, time you're gonna take some
Pretty baby love you're gonna make some
Little lady hearts you're gonna break some
Kinda shady tears you're gonna fake some
Dirty baby we've got a situation
Pretty baby open invitation
Little Lady what a reputation
Kinda shady
Now you're gonna make again

I know you can straddle the atmosphere
A tiny storm in your teacup girl
I know you can battle the masses dear
A tiny storm in your teacup girl

(O o no its getting worse, worse by the minute we're down here in divison in mystery someone send for back up!!)

Every other day you say you're gonna have to bury 'em
Famous last words spoken from the laserium
Descendents had a record sayin' somethin' 'bout Milo
You can take the A train but you're gonna have to lie low

I know you can straddle the atmoshpere
A tiny storm in your teacup girl
I know you can battle the masses dear A tiny storm in your teacup girl

Dirty baby, time you're gonna take some
Pretty baby love you're gonna make some
Little lady hearts you're gonna break some
Kinda shady tears you're gonna fake some
Dirty baby we've got a situation
Pretty baby open invitation
Little Lady what a reputation
Kinda shady
Now you're gonna make again

I know you can straddle the atmoshpere
A tiny storm in your teacup girl
I know we may never get outta here
A tiny storm in your teacup girl
