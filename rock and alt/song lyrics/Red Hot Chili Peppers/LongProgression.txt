everything of first impressions--
sweet successions.

Been around for quite a while. I see you kept it versatile.
Motivated to combine. Even when it's bad, it's fine.
Did she say something that made you cry?
Have you lost it all--the big fall?
Oh, so slowly, comes back holy.

Bishop takes a knight, but I will put up quite a fight.
Oh, here's your ham on rye.
Elementary, the chemistry means everything to me.
Long progression's why.

Set it off to collect knowledge. Quit a job, and go to college.
All about the aftershock. Swedish, Latin, super Funk.
Moses of Manhattan made it great--
pain we celebrate.
And I love--
the long progression, indiscretion.

Bishop takes a knight, but I will put up quite a fight.
Oh, here's your ham on rye.
Elementary, the chemistry means everything to me.
The long progression's why.
In between the reasons are the psychedelic seasons.
Oh, simple as your stride.
Information intimated, elegant and integrated.
Sweep your floors with pride.

Smile, 'cause it's all a ride--all supplied.
And I love everything about this session and this long progession.

Bishop takes a knight, but I will put up quite a fight.
Oh, here's your ham on rye.
Elementary, the chemistry means everything to me.
The long progression's why.
In between the reasons are the psychedelic seasons.
Oh, simple as your stride.
Elementary, the chemistry means everything to me.
The long progression's why.
