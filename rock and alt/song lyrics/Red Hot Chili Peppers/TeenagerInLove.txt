It almost breaks my heart
'Cause I'm so afraid
That we will have to part
Each night I ask the stars up above

Why must I be a teenager in love?

One day I feel so happy
Next day I feel so sad
I guess I'll have to learn the good with the bad
Each night I ask the stars up above

Why must I be a teenager in love?

I cry a tear
For nobody but you
I'll be your lonely one if you should say we are through
Well if you want to make me cry
That won't be so hard to do
If you should say good bye I still go on loving you
Each night I ask the stars up above

Why must I be a teenager in love?

I cry a tear
For nobody but you
I'll be your lonely one if you should say we are through
Well if you want to make me cry
That won't be so hard to do
And if you should say good bye I still go on loving you
Each night I ask the stars up above

Why must I be a teenager in love? [x7]
