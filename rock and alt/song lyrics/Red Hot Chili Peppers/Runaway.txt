

Walkin' around
Out of a town
Walkin' it out
When you want to
Soldiering my style is smiling
Turn it into whatever i've chosen
Take me now to the water

Don't be late i hear it
Gonna be so very great and
Out the door i'm a walking like a runaway
All the reasons that i count of you can hold away
More and more i'm a walking like a runaway

Kick it around
Stare at the ground
Breakin' it down
When you want to
Soldiering my days I've chosen
Dancing round do whatever i want to
Take me now it's the water

Don't be late i hear it
Gonna be so very great and
Out the door i'm a walking like a runaway
All the reasons that i count of you can hold away
More and more i'm a walking like a runaway

I think i know, everything you gonna say
I think you know, don't want to runaway

Don't be late i hear it
Gonna be so very great and
Out the door i'm a walking like a runaway
All the reasons that i count of you can hold away
More and more i'm a walking like a runaway

All the reasons that i count of you can hold away
More and more i'm a walking like a runaway
More and more i'm a walking like a runaway
Out the door i'm a walking like a runaway
