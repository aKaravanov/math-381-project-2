[Flea:]
"We're rolling everybody. It starts with bass."

E I O I E I A
When you give your love away
You get a feeling for

E I O I E I A
Live to love another day
even when you feel unsure
More and more I wanna raise
Raise my bar 
And raise your stakes

E I O I E I A
When I lie they're wide awake
For my son I'll make

[Chorus:]
Tell my boy 
I love him so
Tell him 
So he knows
Lost in Ethiopia
We walk out in that road

E I O I E I A
Somethin' good gonna come your way
Just look out your door

E I O I E I A
Tell 'em what you wanna say
No matter what you might incur

[Chorus:]
Tell my boy 
I love him so
Tell him 
So he knows
Lost in Ethiopia
We walk out in that road

E I O I E I A
Steal my heart to give away
make me want to say

E I O I E I A
You and I are sewn the same
More and more and more 
Each day

[Chorus:]
Tell my boy 
I love him so
Tell him 
So he knows
Lost in Ethiopia
We walk out in that road
