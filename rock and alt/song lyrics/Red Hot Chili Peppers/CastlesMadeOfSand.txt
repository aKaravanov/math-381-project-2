"you're a disgrace"
As she slams the door in his drunken face
And now he stands outside
And all the neighbours start to gossip and drool

He cries "oh girl, you must be mad
What happened to the sweet love you and me had"
Against the door he leans and starts a scene
And his tears fall and burn the garden green

And so castles made of sand,
Fall in the sea eventually

A little indian brave who before he was ten
Played war games in the woods with his indian friends
And he built a dream that when he grew up
He would be a fearless warrior indian chief

Many moons passed and the dream grew strong until tomorrow
He would sing his first war song
And fight his first battle but something went wrong
Surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night

And so castles made of sand
Melts into the sea eventually

There was a young girl whose heart was a frown
Because she was crippled for life and couldn't speak a sound
And she wished and prayed she would stop living
So she decided to die
She drew her wheel chair to the edge of the shore
And to her legs she smiled
"you won't hurt me no more"
But then a sight she'd never seen made her jump and say
"look a golden winged ship is passing my way"
And it really didn't have to stop
It just kept on going

And so castles made of sand
Slips into the sea eventually
