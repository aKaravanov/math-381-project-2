

Deep inside of a parallel universe
It's getting harder and harder to tell
What came first

Under water where thoughts can breathe easily
Far away you were made in a sea
Just like me

[Chorus:]
Christ I'm a sidewinder
I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere
It's everything

Staring straight up into the sky
Oh my my, a solar system that fits in your eye
Microcosm

You could die but you're never dead
Spider web
Take a look at the stars in your head
Fields of space, kid

[Chorus x 2]

Psychic changes are born in your heart
Entertain
A nervous breakthrough that makes us the same
Bless your heart girl

Kill the pressure it's raining on
Salty cheeks
When you hear the beloved song
I am with you

[Chorus x 2]
