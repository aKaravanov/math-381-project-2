

God is good and fate is great
When it feels so strong 
It's hard to wait
You never know how it might unfold
Hearts to break and bodies to hold
Time will tell but it never gets old
Like I told you I'm in for a long long...

Had to have been one of those things
That took place in outer space
A match made in heaven
Not a scratch on her face
Angels must have smoked some dust
Singing songs 'bout in God we trust
Some things slide but this is a must
Like I told you there's a time for finding out

People try to tell me 
What not to do
You shouldn't make it with a younger girl
Too many chances 
For the foot to drop
I tried to tell them that I found a pearl
Like I told you be careful what you're asking for

[Chorus:]
Hey, sister Brutus
Got a mess of a better half
Hey, sister Judas
Even you never had my back

She was the cutest thing 
That I ever did see
Drink in her hand and I don't mean tea
She was with a dude
But I just didn't care
I had to find out these moments are rare
And Stevie says 'All is fair'
Like I told you there is something for everyone

Well I guess I never told you some things
That I really really wanted to say
Did I do everything that I could do
Or did the mice just need to play
Like I told you there is more than meets the eye

[Chorus:]
Hey, sister Brutus
Got a mess of a better half
Hey, sister Judas
Even you never had my back

I'm not trying to point fingers at you
And I'm not trying to lay any blame
But when it comes to the punishment
Girl, you know how to bring the pain
Like I told you, I'd do it all again

[Chorus:]
Hey, sister Brutus
Got a mess of a better half
Hey, sister Judas
Even you never had my back

Come on

Hey, sister Brutus
There's a fury to the woman's wrath
Hey, sister Judas
Even you never had my back
