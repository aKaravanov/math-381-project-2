

Persistant mist that faults my vision
Phsyco-exist point of collision

It's raining in my cranium
My head feels like a stadium

3 pound of grey
About to burst
Inside my 3 pound
Universe

It's raining in my cranium
My head feels like a stadium

These are the melancholy mechanics of my mind [x2]

Symbols I've been given to express my goal
Always come up short
You know they just don't get that low

It's raining in my cranium
My head feels like a stadium

These are the melancholy mechanics of my mind

Quick release chemicals strike with incomprehensible precision
Biorganic electronics targeting microscopic destinations of devistation

Cleaner than light
Meaner than a laser fight in the night 2000
Billions of micro maniacs unknown to most as the uncontrollable soldiers of suffering succotash
Instantaneous infiltration leaves me with a case of bustation, frustration,
Alone in the constellation of alienation detached from empty conversation
I wait
I wait
For the waaaaaave to break.
