Even if you have a cold still
You can cough on me again
I still haven't had my fulfill

End it someday what's that sound?
End it someday what's that sound?
End it someday what's that sound?
End it someday what's that sound?

Broken heart and broken bones
Finger plaster cast and horse pills
One more quirky cliche'd phrase
You're the one I wanna refill

End it someday what's that sound?
End it someday what's that sound?
End it someday what's that sound?
End it someday what's that sound?

[Spoken:]
Most people don't realize
That two large pieces of coral
Which have been painted brown
and attached to his skull
With common wood screws can make a child look like a deer

End it someday what's that sound?
End it someday what's that sound?
End it someday what's that sound?
End it someday what's that sound?

Runny nose and runny yolk
Even if you have a cold still
You can cough on me again
I still haven't had my fulfill

End it someday what's that sound?
End it someday what's that sound?
End it someday what's that sound?
End it someday what's that sound?
