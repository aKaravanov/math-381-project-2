Use just once and destroy
Invasion of our piracy
Afterbirth of a nation
Starve without your skeleton key

I love you for what I am not
I did not want what I have got
A blanket acne'ed with cigarette burns
Speak at once while taking turns

What is wrong with me
What is wrong with me
What is wrong with me

I'm gonna do with what you think
If you ever think at all
Bipolar opposites attract
All of a sudden my water broke

I love you for what I am not
I do not want what I have got
A blanket acne'ed with cigarette burns
Second-rate third degree burns

What is wrong with me?
What is wrong with me?
What do I think I think?

Hate, hate your enemies
Save, save your friends
Find, find your place
Speak, speak the truth

What is wrong with me?
What is wrong with me?
What is wrong with me?
What do I think I think?

Use just once and destroy
Invasion of our piracy
Afterbirth of a nation
Starve without your skeleton key

What is wrong with me?
What is wrong with me?
What is wrong with me?
What do I think I think?
What is wrong with me?
What is wrong with me?
What is wrong with me?
What do I think I think?
