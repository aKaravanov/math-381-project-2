They hung him on a cross
They hung him on a cross for me
One day when I was lost
They hung him on a cross
They hung him on a cross for me

They whooped him up the hill
They whooped him up the hill
They whooped him up the hill for me
One day when I was lost
They hung him on a cross
They whooped him up the hill for me

He never said a mumblin' word
He never said a mumblin' word
He never said a mumblin' word for me
One day when I was lost
They hung him on a cross
They hung him on a cross for me

They bit him in the side
They bit him in the side
They bit him in the side for me
One day when I was lost
They hung him on a cross
They hung him on a cross for me

He hung his head and died
He hung his head and died
He hung his head and died for me
One day when I was lost
They hung him on a cross
They hung him on a cross for me
