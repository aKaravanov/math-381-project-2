You wanted it to be the way you like it, I'm
I'm no lover
We wanted you to see it the way you wanted
It's all right

I could be crazy, but I could be human
I never wanted to open your eyes
I could be crazy, but I could be human
I never wanted to open your eyes

I'm no lover
You wanted to be living up in the air, yeah
I'm no lover
But please let go of the human
That's me

I could be crazy, but I could be human
I never wanted to open your eyes
I could be crazy, but I could be human
I never wanted to open your eyes
