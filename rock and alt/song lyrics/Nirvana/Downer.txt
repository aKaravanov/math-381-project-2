Act out of loyalty
Defend every country
Wish away the pain

Hand out lobotomies
To save little families
Surrealistic fantasy
Bland, boring, plain!

Hold me down is restitution
Living out your date with fusion
Is the whole fleece shunning bastards?
Don't feel guilty masturbating

Somebody said that they're not much like I am
I know I can
Make enough of the words
You go along I sing a song

Sickening pessimist hypocrite master
Conservative Communist apocalyptic bastard
Thank you dear God for putting me on this Earth
I feel very privileged in debt for my thirst!

Hold me down is restitution
Living out your date with fusion
Is the whole fleece shunning bastards?
Don't feel guilty masturbating

Somebody said that they're not much like I am
I know I can
Make up enough of the words
You go along I sing a song
