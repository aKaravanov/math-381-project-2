

If it's a hard, cold beat
You can go dance every night
You won't get it shown
It won't be missing the spice
You won't know that it hit ya

Nothing'll make you win
Even the law won't fight
Yeah!

Watching to wait, you waiter
You only age your gutters
I got respawned and rised
Seeking to save your garden

We can't go to the day lord's house
We only have your toner
We ordered too many cocktails
Watching the way of the world
