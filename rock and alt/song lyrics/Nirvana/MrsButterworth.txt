Shit
Your life is bogus
Bull
Your life is crime
Crime
Your life is hell
Hell

I'm gonna die
Start a new union
I'm gonna die
With my libido
I'm gonna die
Start a new union
I'm gonna die
Don't fuck with me

Your life is shit
Shit
Your life is clean
It's clean
Your life is lame
Without some friends
Your life is stale, frail
Frail

I'm gonna die
Start a new union
I'm gonna hell
Help my libido
I'm gonna die
Start a new union
I'm gonna hell
Help my libido
I'm gonna die
Start a new union
I'm gonna hell
Help my libido
I'm gonna die
Start a new union
I'm gonna die
Watch the pain

Your life is shit

I'm gonna open up myself a flea market
I'm gonna open up myself a flea market
And you're gonna wish that you did
Gonna retire on the profits
First off, I'm gonna empty out all of my Mrs. Butterworth jars
And I'm gonna put 'em on a shelf with my 800 dollar a month tax free Century21 shop
And then I am going to put my Mrs. Butterworth syrup jars on the shelf
Next to all the commemorative fast food chain glasses and cups
I've accumulated over the past 62 years
Then I'm going to get some plywood
I'm going to get some plywood and cut them up into two by two feet squares
Then I'm going to get some burlap
And I'm going to cut them into two by two feet squares
And then I'm going to put them onto the pieces of plywood
And then I'm going to go to the beach
I'm going to go to the beach
And I'm gonna collect some shells and driftwood
And then I'm going to take the shells and driftwood and glue them onto the plywood and burlap
And sell 'em for lots of money
People will be paying top dollar for my kids' new used new toys and clothing
Then maybe someday I can get rid of that piss-stained mattress I've been sleeping on

I'm gonna die
Start a new union
I'm gonna hell
Help my libido
I'm gonna die
Start a new union
I'm gonna hell
Help my libido
I'm gonna die
Start a new union
I'm gonna hell
Help my libido
I'm gonna die
Start a new union
I'm gonna die
Watch the pain
