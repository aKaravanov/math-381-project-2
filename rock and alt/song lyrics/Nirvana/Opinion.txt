Congratulations you have won
It's a years subscription of bad puns
And it makes your story of concern
And they set it up before it burns

My opinions, hmm...

And there seems to be a problem here
And the scale of emotion seems to clear
Now they rise and fall like wall street stock
And they have an affect on our heartbeat's tock

Our opinions, hmm...

Congratulations you have won
It's a years subscription of bad puns
And it makes your story of concern
And you set it up before it burns

Your opinions, hmm...
