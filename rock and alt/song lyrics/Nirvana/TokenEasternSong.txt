Something else is something new
I'm not gonna make you dream
Suicide is something mean
I'm not gonna make you gruel
It's something else, it's something new
I'm not gonna make you through
It's something else, it's something new

Hold it in your gut...

I'm not gonna make you croon
Something sad, something blue
I'm not gonna make you scream
In this hour, it's something mean
I'm not gonna make it through
Something else, it's something new
I'm not gonna make you dream
In this hour, it's something mean

Hold it in your gut...
