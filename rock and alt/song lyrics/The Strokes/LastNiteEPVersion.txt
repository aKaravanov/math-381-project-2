"Oh, baby, I feel so down.
Oh it turns me off,
When I feel left out"

So I walked out:
"Little girl, I don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking out that door"

Well, I've been in town for just now fifteen minutes now
And baby, I feel so down
And I don't know why
I keep walkin' for miles

And people they don't understand
No, girlfriends, they can't understand
Your Grandsons, they won't understand
On top of this, I ain't ever gonna understand...

Last night, she said:
"Oh, baby, don't feel so down.
Oh, it turns me off,
When I feel left out"

So I, I turned around:
"Oh, baby, gonna be alright"
It was a great big lie
'Cause I left that night, yeah

Oh it's alright, baby

Yeah!

And people they don't understand
No, girlfriends, they can't understand
In spaceships, they won't understand
And on top of this ain't ever gonna understand
