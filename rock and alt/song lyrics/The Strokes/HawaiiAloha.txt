Sunny laid back L.A.
Whether you're in New York
Comfort 'round your block
Whether you're in the U.K.
Where the sky is dark
And the grass is kinda green
You know like Central Park

Still my favorite place in this whole wide world
Has got to be in the middle of the ocean floor
I see you poking out of the ocean, Paradise on Earth

The 50th state - WHAT?!
Hawaii

Ooooooh Oooh
Ooooh Oooh Oooh
I wanna live in somewhere different. Oh oh oh
A nuclear disaster might be on our way
But I don't care, I'm in the U.S.A

Whether we're drunk or stoned
or we're sober and old
if I'm with you I'm a happy man
If you feel safe and cold
while you count your gold
If your problem is you can't find
your remote control

Still my favorite person in this whole wide world
Is the woman who can understand every word
And when she speaks to me
She makes me see the world
As my favorite place...
Hawaii

We got it made
Oh Oh Oh Oh
Yes, I know
Can we go
By plane or boat
Oh Oh Oh Oh

Whether you take it slow or you let me go
Whether you tell me something that I did not know
Whether you're neat and polite or you scream and fight
Whether you keep something from me that I would not like

Still my favourite attitude in this world so far
Is the friendly spirit of an iron heart
I like the way folks are in this most special place
I don't care what happens I'm taking a plane

Hawaii Ha Aw Wa II !!
I said
Hawaii Ha Aw Wa II !!
I said
Hawaii Ha Aw Wa II !!
I said
Hawaii Ha Aw Wa II !!

Kauai or Oahu
Molokai or Lanai
Maui and the big guy,
A.k.a. Hawaii

Hawaii Ha Aw Wa II !!
Ha Aw Wa II !!
Hawaii

Ooooooh Oooh
Ooooh Oooh Oooh
All I want to do is something different
Oh let me in
Cut off from Malaysia
Back in who knows when
Oh we got
kinda lost
But my God
What a place!
I profess
Airforce Jets
Cannot take
Away my soul
