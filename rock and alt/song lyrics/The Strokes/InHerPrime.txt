And this house was built on mama's broken dreams
I put it all aside
When she looked me in the eye
Oh...

And arrest these teachers for what they have read
And give all your money to the living dead
Like a call girl in her prime
Arriving just in time
Oh...

I am a sentimental man
I try to reach to God with just one hand
Rejecting offers to be with you
Oh he does it to
Get you by your side
A new way to wave goodbye
And I'm waiting...
My lady!

And I'm redefining what they could not perceive
Upon their big arrival and they cheat on three
And he took them to his side
And no they could not wait to hide

I am a sentimental man
I try to reach to God with just one hand
Rejecting offers to be with you
Oh he does it to
Keep you by your side
A new way to say goodbye
And I'm waiting...
My lady!

And I lived this life, I was just seventeen
And this house was built on mama's broken dreams
I put it all aside
And she looked me in the eye
Was I gone for too long?
Did I say something wrong or right?
