

Slip back out of whack at your best
It's a nightmare
So I'm joining the army

No house phones, but can I still call?
Will you wait for me now?

We got the right 'cause they'll fight to use it
Got everything but you can just choose it
I won't just be a puppet on a string

Don't go that way
I'll wait for you

And I'm tired of all your friends
Listening at your door
But I want what's better for you

So long, my friend and adversary
But I'll wait for you

Get dressed, jump out of bed into a vest
Are you OK?
I've been all around this town
Everybody's singing the same song for ten years

I'll wait for you
Will you wait for me too?

And they sacrifice their lives
And they're lying about those odds
Oh, they've said it a billion times and they'll say it again
So long my adversary and friend

Don't go that way
I'll wait for you

I'm tired of all your friends
Banging down your door
Get up in the morning, yelling "No more!"
So long, my friend and adversary
I'll be waiting for you
