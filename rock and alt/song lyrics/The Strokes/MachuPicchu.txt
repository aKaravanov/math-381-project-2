Putting your body on the line, for less
Didn't you know there was a choice?
It's never yours but someone else's voice

Selling your body to the street
Selling your girlfriend's to the night for cheap
Wearing a jacket made of meat
Sealing a letter made with horse's feet

And now you've heard that

Waves turn to grey
Life in the shade
A violent crime
And that's the USA

Platinum's on the rise
Playboys in disguise
I'm just trying' to find
A mountain I can climb

Putting your patience to the test
Putting your body on the line, for less
Didn't you know there was a choice?
It's never yours but someone else's voice

And now you see that

Blondes turn to grey
Life in the shade
A violent crime
And that's the USA

Porn's on the rise
Psycho's in disguise
I'm just tryin' to find
A mountain I can climb

Darling, aren't you gonna tell us
They're gonna be oh so jealous
We're gonna be oh so silent
They're gonna be stoned in silence

I didn't want to ask you baby
I didn't want you to have to ask anybody baby
Is anybody asking maybe?
Can anyone even hear me?
Why are you waiting beyond the door?

Life turns to dust
And rain turns to rust
Gossip is a truth
And money pays for the lies we trust
Your love is a surprise
Homeless saints are in disguise
I'm just tryin' to find
A nice place for you and I
