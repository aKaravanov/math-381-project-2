

I듈'm a one-way motorway
I'm the road that drives away
Follows you back home

I듈'm a street light shining
I'm a white light blinding bright
Burning off and on

It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these time and time again

I듈'm a new day rising
I'm a brand new sky
To hang the stars upon tonight

But I듈'm a little divided
Do I stay or run away
And leave it all behind?

[4x]
It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these time and time again
