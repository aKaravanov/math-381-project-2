You can play in a convertible child
I've never been driven baby you're the first
Come on baby drive me wild, ooh

Ooh look at me I'm a telephone
Whatever you want just dial
Come on baby please it's so easy
Do it baby drive me wild

Come on baby do it drive me wild
Do it baby drive me wild

Ooh look at me I'm a radio
Call me up and make a request
If you want anything just name it
When I'm bad baby I'm the best

Come on baby do it drive me wild
Do it baby drive me wild
Come on baby do it drive me wild
Do it baby drive me wild

Ooh look at me I'm a baby doll
Stick me up and I'll smile
Come on baby please it's so easy
Do it baby drive me wild

Come on baby do it drive me wild
Do it baby drive me wild
Come on baby do it drive me wild
Do it baby drive me wild

Drive me wild
Do it baby drive me wild
Drive me wild
Do it baby drive me wild

Come on baby do it drive me wild
Do it baby drive me wild
Come on baby do it drive me wild
Do it baby drive me wild

Come on baby do it drive me wild
Do it baby drive me wild
Come on baby do it drive me wild
Do it baby drive me wild
