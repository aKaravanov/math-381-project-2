

Have you found
Your way around
The down and out?
I know it must seem long so long

I'm still trying
To keep this time
From running out
Head down
Always moving on
And on and on

I've never heard this warning
Another early morning
Takes me
Wakes me into
If you could manage me
I'll try to manage you
But lately it's all I ever do

I felt like this on my way home
I'm not scared
I passed the bolts and locking doors
I'm not scared

I'll never tell you the secret I'm holding
I know these things must bore you
I can't find another way

I'll never tell you the secrets I'm holding
I love this leash that holds me
When I try to run away

I felt like this on my way home
I'm not scared
I pass the boats in the kingdom
I'm not scared
