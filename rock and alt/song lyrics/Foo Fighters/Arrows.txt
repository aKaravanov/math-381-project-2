

She was a friend of mine
Alone on a dead end street
Dancing through life
On the front lines

She led a quiet life
Ends, they don't always meet
Years passed her by
Waiting to rise

She had arrows in her eyes
Fear where her heart should be
War in her mind

Arrows in her eyes
Fear where her heart should be
War in her mind
Shame in her cries

Arrows in her eyes
Tears in her arteries
War in her mind
Shame as she cries
Fire away

Under a silent light
Screaming biology
Queen Gemini
The world in her sights

I want a new life
Forming inside of me
Blessed and born
Into this fire

You had arrows in your eyes
Fear where your heart should be
War in your mind

Arrows in your eyes
Fear where your heart should be
War in your mind
Shame in your cries

Arrows in your eyes
Tears in your arteries
War in your mind
Shame as you cry
Fire away

Arrows in her eyes
Fear where her heart should be
War in her mind
Shame in her cries

Arrows in her eyes
Tears in her arteries
War in her mind
Shame as she cries
Fire away
