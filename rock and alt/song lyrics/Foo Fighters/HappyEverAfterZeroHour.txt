Another perfect day
Busy counting shadows on the wall
The weeds are swallowing up
The flower bed
Roses in the whiskey jar
Blood on the thorns
Drink until the taste is gone

Cracks in the floorboards are deep
From dancing to the sound of candles
Burning out
Heavy from writing
Your resignations
Licking bitter envelopes
Blood on your tongue
Drink until the taste is gone

Where is your Shangri la now?
Where is your Shangri la now?
Counting down to zero hour
There ain't no superheroes now
There ain't no superheroes
They're underground
Happy ever after
Counting down to zero hour

There ain't no superheroes now
There ain't no superheroes
They're underground
Happy ever after
Counting down to zero hour

Where is your Shangri la now?
Where is your Shangri la now?
Counting down to zero hour
There ain't no superheroes now
There ain't no superheroes
They're underground
Happy ever after
Counting down to zero hour

There ain't no superheroes now
There ain't no superheroes
They're underground
Happy ever after
Counting down to zero hour
