

I can be your ride away
So we can get out of here
I've always been the one
Who runs from everyone
'Cause everyone's just too weird

Sink with someone tied to me
I'm making you volunteer
Another one has come and gone
They crawl along
Make them disappear

Dress me up in stitches
It's now or never
Tired of wearing black and blue
Dress me up in stitches
It's now or never
Dying to get my blood on you
Blood on you

Take another stab at me
I promise in time I'll heal
But yesterday went on and on
A bit too long

Waited out on high street
There's nothing to find out here
Another day has come and gone
They crawl along
Wasting all these years

Dress me up in stitches
It's now or never
Tired of wearing black and blue
Dress me up in stitches
It's now or never
Dying to get my blood on you

How can you go on
When you're murdering someone
Killing me like you do

Give me stitches now or never
Give me stitches now or never
Give me stitches now or never
Blood on you
Blood on you
Blood on you
Blood on you

Dress me up in stitches
It's now or never
Tired of wearing black and blue
Dress me up in stitches
It's now or never
Dying to get my blood on you

How can you go on
When you're murdering someone
Killing me like you do

Give me stitches now or never
Give me stitches now or never
Give me stitches now or never
Give me stitches now or never
Blood on you
Blood on you
