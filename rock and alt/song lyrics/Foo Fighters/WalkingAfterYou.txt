

Tonight I'm tangled
In my blanket of clouds
Dreaming aloud

Things just won't do without you
Matter of fact
I'm on your back [3x]

[2x]
If you walk out on me
I'm walking after you

If you'd accept surrender
I'll give up some more
Weren't you adored

I cannot be without you
Matter of fact
I'm on your back [3x]

[2x]
If you walk out on me
I'm walking after you

Another heart is cracked in two
I'm on your back

I cannot be without you
Matter of fact
I'm on your back

[3x]
If you walk out on me
I'm walking after you

Another heart is cracked in two
I'm on your back
