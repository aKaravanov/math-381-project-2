Do you remember?
The sound of your laughter
Wrapped in mine
That was all
I need to fall
In love

This matter
It's something bigger
Anything ever graced my heart
That was all
I could fall
In love with you
And I can't stall
This now

Did you find some happiness with me?
Now I know the way true love should be

Dear lover
Do you remember?
The piece of my heart that I gave you
That was all
I need to fall
In love

It shattered
Slipped through my fingers
Floated down safely into your hands
That was all
I could fall
In love with you
I can't stall
This now

Did you find some happiness with me?
Now I know the way true love should be

Did you find some happiness with me?
