You’re gonna give your love to me
Give me love'n every night and day
Love is real, not fade away
Love is real, not fade away
Love is real, not fade away

Buy you a diamond and a Cadillac
Show it to you baby when I get back
Well your love for me better be real
Then I'll know just how you feel
Said love is real, not fade away
Love is real, not fade away

I’m a-gonna show you how it’s gonna be
You’re gonna give your love to me
Give me love'n every night and day
Love is real, not fade away
Love is real, not fade away
Love is real, not fade away
[Repeat until fade]
