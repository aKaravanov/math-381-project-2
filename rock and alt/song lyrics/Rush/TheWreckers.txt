

The breaker's roar
On an unseen shore,
In the teeth of a hurricane,
Oh, we struggle in vain

A hellish night,
A ghostly light,
Appears through the driving rain,
Salvation in a human chain

All I know is that sometimes you have to be wary of a miracle too good to be true,
All I know is that sometimes the truth is contrary everything in life you thought you knew
All I know is that sometimes you have to be wary, 'cause sometimes the target is you

Driven aground,
With that awful sound
Drowned by the cheer from the shore,
Oh, we wonder what for?

The people swarm
Through the darkling storm.
Gather everything they can score
'Til their backs won't bear any more.

All I know is that sometimes you have to be wary of a miracle too good to be true,
All I know is that sometimes the truth is contrary everything in life you thought you knew,
All I know is that sometimes you have to be wary of a miracle too good to be true,
All I know is that sometimes the truth is contrary, 'cause sometimes the target is you.

The breaker's roar
On an unseen shore,
In the teeth of an icy grave,
In the teeth of an icy grave

Whoa, the human chain
Leaves a bloody stain,
Washed away in the pounding waves,
Washed away in the pounding waves

All I know is that sometimes you have to be wary of a miracle too good to be true,
All I know is that sometimes the truth is contrary everything in life you thought you knew
All I know is that sometimes you have to be wary, 'cause sometimes the target is you.
All I know is that memory can be too much to carry striking down like a bolt from the blue
All I know is that sometimes the truth is contrary everything in life you thought you knew

All I know is that sometimes the truth is contrary, 'cause sometimes the target is you
