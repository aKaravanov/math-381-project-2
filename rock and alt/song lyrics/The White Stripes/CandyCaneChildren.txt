

Why don't you open me up?

Candy Cane Girl
Don't you know your name, girl?
Twelve people gonna ask you just the same, girl
What a world
Christmas once again, girl
That's three hundred and sixty four tears, girl

So when Christmas finally comes
And nobody's got a gun
And you think it might be fun
To hang around
Think again girl

Why don't you open me up, huh?

Candy Cane Boy
Don't you know your name, boy?
Nine people gonna tell you just the same, boy
You're alone, son
In the middle of a million
And nobody knows how to talk to children

Oh, when Christmas finally comes
And nobody's got a gun
And you think it might be fun
To get a new toy
Think again boy

Oh, when Christmas finally comes
And no one's got a gun
And you think it might be fun
To make a stand
Think again man
