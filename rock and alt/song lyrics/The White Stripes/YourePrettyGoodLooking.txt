

Oh yeah you're pretty good looking for a girl 
but your back is so broken 
and this feeling's still gonna linger on 
until the year 2525 now

yeah you're pretty good looking for a girl 
your eyes are wide open 
and your thoughts have been stolen by the boys 
who took you out and bought you everything you
want now

yeah you're pretty good looking 
oh yeah
you're pretty good looking
yes you're pretty good looking
oh yeah
for a girl 

lots of people in this world 
but I want to be your boy 
to me that thought is sounding so absurd
and I don't wanna be your toy
cause you're pretty good looking for a girl 
my future's wide open 
but this feeling's still gonna linger on
until I know everything I need to know now

yeah you're pretty good looking 
oh yeah
you're pretty good looking
yes you're pretty good looking
oh yeah
for a girl
