My little baby brother used to play down on the floor,
But now he's not satisfied to do it anymore.
He's got a funny habit and I don't know why,
He walks around the ceiling now, stepping on the flies.

Baby brother, baby brother,
Well, he learned to crawl on the kitchen wall,
Baby brother.

Well, just the other day, well-a bless-a my soul,
I found him swimming round in the goldfish bowl.
Since nobody told him that he hadn't oughta,
He swam around for hours with his head underwater.

Baby brother, baby brother,
Well, you may swim all you wish but don't eat no fish,
Baby brother.

Well, my little baby brother, he's a cute little cuss,
But it's plain to see that he's not one of us.
Where'd we get him? I know you're gonna ask it.
We found him on the porch in a crazy little basket.

Baby brother, baby brother,
Although your hair is blue, think the world of you,
Baby brother.

Well, I bought my baby brother a toy balloon,
He let it get away and it floated toward the moon.
Instead of crying, he climbed up on the fence,
Started flapping his arms and we ain't seen him since.

Baby brother, baby brother,
Although you're out in outer space, I can still see your face.
It's baby brother.

Although you're out in outer space, I can still see your face,
Baby brother.
Although you're out in outer space, I can still see your face,
It's baby brother.
