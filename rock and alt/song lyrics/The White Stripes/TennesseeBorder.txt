

Her eyes were blue, her hair was auburn,
Her smile was like an angel fair.
She was her daddy's only daughter on the Tennessee border.

One night, I took a ride just across that line,
I picked her up in a pickup truck.
And she broke this heart of mine,
Her mama said: "No, she's my only daughter"
But we got married on the Tennessee border.

The roses were blooming on the border,
And the moon was shining over there.
And her personality made me want her on the Tennessee border.

One night, I took a ride just to pass the time,
I picked her up in a pickup truck.
She broke this heart of mine,
Her mama said: "No, she's on the corner"
We got married on the Tennessee border.
