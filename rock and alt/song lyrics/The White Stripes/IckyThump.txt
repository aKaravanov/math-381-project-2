Icky thump
Who'da thunk?
Sittin' drunk on a wagon to Mexico

Ah well
What a chump
Well my head got a bump
When I hit it on the radio

Redhead señorita
Looking dead
Came and said
"need a bed?"
En Español

I said
"Gimme a drink a water
I'm gonna 'sing around the collar'
And I don't need a microphone"

[guitar solo]
[keyboard solo]

Icky thump
With a lump in my throat
Grabbed my coat
And I was freaking
I was ready to go!

And I swear
Besides the hair
She had one white eye
One blank stare
Lookin' up
Lyin' there

On the stand
Near her hand
Was a candy cane
Black rum, sugar cane
Dry ice (and) something strange

La la, la la la la la la la la la laaa laaa laaa

[keyboard solo]

White Americans, what?
Nothing better to do?
Why don't you kick yourself out?
You're an immigrant too?

Who's usin' who?
What should we do?
Well you can't be a pimp
And a prostitute too

Icky thump, handcuffed to a bunk
Robbed blind
Looked around
And there was nobody else

Left alone
I hit myself with a stone
Went home
And learned how to clean up after myself
