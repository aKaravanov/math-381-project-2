Rag & Bone!
Rag & Bone!
Rag & Bone!
Rag & Bone!

[Jack:]
Meg, look at this place
This place looks like a mansion!
It's like a mansion, look at all this stuff!
Look, I see something over there.

We got you here selling rag and bone
Bring out your junk and we'll give it a home
A broken trumpet or a telephone
Ah, come on, come on, come on
Come and give it to me

Yeah!

Come on, come on, come on
Come on and give it to me

Rag & Bone!
Rag & B one!

Ah, come on, come on, come on
Come on and give it to me

All of your pretty
Your pretty little Rags & Bones

[Jack:] Well, look at all this, you don't want it?

[Meg:] What is that?

[Jack:]
You sure you don't want it? Take it.
They're just things you don't want.
I can use 'em.
Meg can use 'em
We can do something with 'em
We'll make something out of 'em
Make some money out of 'em at least.

Hey if you ain't gonna use it, just give it to us
We'll give it a home

Well, I hope you got something shoddy for me
Everybody got a Christmas tree
Can you part with a toilet seat?
Ah, jump up, jump up, jump up
Come on and give it to me

Rag & Bone!

We wanna get it Granny, while it's hot
You think it's trash Granny, but it's not
Oh, we'll be taking whatever you got
Ah, give up, give up, give up
Come on and give it to me

Woo!

All of your pretty
Your pretty little Rags & Bones

[Meg:] I saw some stuff in here, now are you gonna give it to us?

[Jack:] Ah, Meg, don't be rude

[Meg:] Why not?

[Jack:]
They might need it.
And if you don't want it, we'll take it
And if you don't wanna give it to us,
We'll keep walking by
We'll keep going we're not tired
But, got plenty of places to go
Lots of homes we ain't been to yet
The west side
The south-west side
Middle east
Rich house
Dog house
Outhouse
Old folks' house
House for unwed mothers
Halfway homes
Catacombs
Twilight Zones
Looking for Technic's turntables to gramophones
So take a last lick of your ice-cream cones
And lock up what you still wanna own
But please be kind
And don't rewind

All of your pretty
Your pretty little Rags & Bones
Your pretty little Rags & Bones

Ah, jump up, jump up, jump up
Come on and give it to me

Your pretty little Rags & Bones

[Jack & Meg:]
Ah, come on, come on, come on
Come on and give it to us!

[Jack:]
Yeah!
Yeah, yeah!
Oh yeah!
Yeah!

[Meg:] Yeah!

[Jack & Meg, x13:] Yeah!
