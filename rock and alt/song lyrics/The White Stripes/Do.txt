

well somebody walked up to me
but i didn't know what to do
and then somebody said hello to me 
but i didn't know what to do
because i think that my words could get
twisted so i bend my back over take a 
gulp be funny cause i know there's nothing i can do 

then my mother tried to pick me up
when i was sittin' down on the ground
something forced my little eyes come open 
but i couldn't make out the sound
it doesn't matter cause my eyes are lying
and they don't have emotion
don't wanna be social, can't take it when they hate me
but i know there's nothing i can do 

when my thoughts start to feel like mine
they're taken from me it seems to happen
all the time (every time)
and the feelings that are fine for you
there's somebody there
who doesn't think they are true
so think of something new
there's nothing left to do

and then my idols walk next to me
i look up at them they fade away
it's a destruction of a mystery
the more i listen to what they say
so does that mean that there's no more doin' 
and there's no more thinkin' 
and there's no more feeling 
cause there's no right opinion 
so can you tell me what i'm supposed to do
