

The big three killed my baby 
no money in my hand again 
the big three killed my baby 
nobody's coming home again 

Their ideas made me want to spit 
a hundred dollars goes down the pit 
30,000 wheels are rollin' 
and my stick shift hands are swollen 
everything involved is shady 
the big three killed my baby 

The big three killed my baby 
no money in my hand again 
the big three killed my baby 
nobody's coming home again 

Why dont you take the day off and try to repair
a billion others dont seem to care 
better ideas are stuck in the mud 
the motors runnin' on tuckers blood 
dont let them tell you the future's electric 
cause gasolines not measured in metric 
30,000 wheels are spinnin' 
and oil company faces are grinnin' 
now my hands are turnin' red 
and i found out my baby is dead 

The big three killed my baby 
no money in my hand again 
the big three killed my baby 
nobody's coming home again 

Well i've said it now, nothings changed 
people are burnin for pocket change 
and creative minds are lazy 
and the big three killed my baby 

And my baby's my common sense 
so dont feed me planned obsolescence 
yeah my baby's my common sense 
so dont feed my planned obsolescence 
im about to have another blowout 
im about to have another blowout
