

They're lookin' at me
No where to go
And what they're sayin'
Just don't know
Floor below me
Ceiling above
I'm in the middle
Nobody to love [x4]

They're lookin' at me
No where to go
And what they're sayin'
You just don't know
Floor below you now
Ceiling above
You're in the middle
Nobody to love
Nobody to love
Yeah [x5]
