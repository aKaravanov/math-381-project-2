I grabbed up my suitcase, I took off down the road
When I got there she was, laying on the cooling board

You know it's so hard to love someone that don't love you

Well I got up this morning the break of day 
Just hugging the pillow, she used to lay

Just hugging the pillow, where my baby used to lay
