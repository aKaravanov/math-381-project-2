Whistlen' loud and merry
Made the woods round him ring
And he charmed the heart of a lady
Charmed the heart of a lady

"How old are you my pretty little miss?"
"How old are you my honey?"
She answered him with a loving smile
"I'll be sixteen come Sunday"
Said "I'll be sixteen come Sunday"

"Come and go with me, my pretty little miss
Come and go with me, my honey
I'll take you where the grass grows green
You never will want for money"
Said, "You never will want for money"

"Pull off, pull off your long, blue gloves
Made of Spanish leather
Give to me your lily-white hand
And we'll ride off together"
Said, "We'll ride off together"

Well, she pulled off her long, blue gloves
Made of Spanish leather
And gave to him her lily-white hand
And bid farewell forever
And they both rode off together

Well, late last night the boss came home
Inquiring about his lady
The servant spoke before she thought
"She been with Black Jack Davey
Rode off with Black Jack Davey"

"Come on, come on my coal-black horse
You're speedier than the gray
I'll ride all day and I'll ride all night
And I'll overtake my lady
Yeah, I'll overtake my lady"

Well, he rode all night 'til the broad daylight
'Til he came to a river ragin'
And there he spied his darlin' bride
In the arms of Black Jack Davey
Wrapped up with Black Jack Davey

Would you forsake your house and home?
Would you forsake your baby?
Would you forsake your husband, too
To go with Black Jack Davey?
Run off with Black Jack Davey?

"Yes I've forsaken my house and home
And I've forsaken my baby
And I've forsaken my husband too to go with Black Jack Davey
I'm in love with Black Jack Davey"

Last night I slept on a feather bed
Between my husband and baby
And tonight I lay on the river banks
In the arms of Black Jack Davey
I'm in love with Black Jack Davey
