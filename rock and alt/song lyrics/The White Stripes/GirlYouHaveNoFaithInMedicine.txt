Oh, girl, you have no faith in medicine
Acetaminophen
You see the medicine
Oh, girl

Is there a way to find the cure for this
Implanted in a pill?
Is it just the name upon the bottle
Which determines if it will?

Is the problem you're allergic
To a well familiar name?
Do you have a problem with this one
If the results are the same?

Acetaminophen
You see the medicine
Oh, girl, you have no faith in medicine
Oh, girl, you have no faith in medicine
Acetaminophen
You see the medicine
Oh, girl

Girl, you have no faith in medicine
Acetaminophen
You see the medicine

Well strip the bark right off a tree
And just hand it this way
Don't even need a drink of water
To make the headache go away
Give me a sugar pill
And watch me just rattle
Down the street

Acetaminophen
You see the medicine
Oh, girl, you have no faith in medicine
Oh, girl, you have no faith in medicine
Oh, girl [4x]
