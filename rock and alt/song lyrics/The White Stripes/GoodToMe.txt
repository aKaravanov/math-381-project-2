I get in, start it up, and I go
It not a vintage Cadillac
But it always gets me there and back

And it'll always be good to me
Always be good to me
Always be good to me
Always be good to me

I got a beat up Silvertone amp
I plug it in and it sounds like a champ
It's not a Fender Tweed Deluxe
It only cost me a couple a bucks

But it'll always sound good to me
Always sound good to me
Always sound good to me
Always sound good to me

I got a girlfriend she's so true
And no other kinda girl will do
'Cause I've known lots of girls in the past
And I knew none of their love would last

But this one will always be true to me
Always be true to me
Always be true to me
Always be true to me
Always be good to me
Always be good to me
Always be good to me
Always be good to me

Good to me
Good to me
Good to me, hey!
