It's really got me snoring
I'm wearing out the flooring
In a cheap hotel
But I don't have to work it
And I might be sinning
But I'm never gonna have to hear
The rings of school bells

Well, don't you remember?
You told me in December
That a boy is not a man
Until he makes a stand
Well, I'm not a genius
But, baby, you'll remember this
I never said I ever wanted to be a man

Yeah, I get nervous when she comes around
When she comes around
When she comes around
I get nervous when she comes around
When she comes around
When she comes around
Mm, I get nervous when she comes around
When she comes around
When she comes around
I get nervous when she comes around
When she comes around
When she comes around

Hey!

My mom is so caring
She's really got me staring
At all the crazy little things
She does for sure
And I can't seem to think of
Another kind of love
That a boy could ever get
From anyone but her

I get nervous when she comes around
When she comes around
When she comes around
I get nervous when she comes around
When she comes around
When she comes around
Yeah, I get nervous when she comes around
When she comes around
When she comes around
I get nervous when she comes around
When she comes around
When she comes around
Alright!
