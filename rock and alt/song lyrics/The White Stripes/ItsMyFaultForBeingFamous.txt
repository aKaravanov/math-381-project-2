

She stuck a cellphone camera right into my face 
With a flick of my wrist, I filled her nose with mace 
The cops want to know what was wrong with me 
Didn't give me a chance to explain it, see? 
It ain't her fault for being careless 
It ain't her fault for being brainless 
It ain't her fault for being hopeless 
But it's my fault for being famous 
Yeah 

I'm at the LAX, just checking my bag 
When up comes a little paparazzi scumbag 
I took a laptop, slapped him upside his head 
The cops want to know why I left him for dead 
It ain't his fault for being nameless 
It ain't his fault for being thoughtless 
It ain't his fault for being shameless 
But it's my fault for being famous 

I had a sweet old lady walk up to me 
Wanted to get a photograph for her grandson to see 
And as the digital camera lit up the place 
She unloaded a chrome .45 in my face 
But it ain't her fault for being ruthless 
Ain't her fault for being toothless 
Ain't her fault for being blameless 
But it's my fault for being famous
