

Well we're back in school again
and I don't really know anyone
I really want to be your friend
cause I don't really know anyone

And the bus is pulling
up to your house
I wish you could be sitting here
next to me
I didn't see you at summer school
but I saw you at the corner store
and I don't want to break the rules
cause I've broken them all before
But every time I see you
I wonder why
I don't break a couple rules
so that you'll notice me

Sister do you know my name?
I've heard it before but I want you to know

I got a funny feeling
that it's gonna work out
cause now I see you sitting here next to me
