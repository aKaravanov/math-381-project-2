Yeah, you’re right

Ponder what’s there, 1, 2, 3

Though I hear you calling
I will not answer
Though I hear you calling
I will not answer

And the sun may shine
Right through your tooth, dear
And the wind may blow
Right through my ear

Though I hear you calling
I will not answer
Oh, I hear you calling
No, I will not answer

I broke your code
And I broke your code

Come on hit me, yeah, yeah
Come on hit me, yeah, yeah
Come on hit me, yeah, yeah

Come on hit me, yeah, yeah
Come on hit me, yeah, yeah
Come on hit me, yeah, yeah

I will not answer, yeah
Though I hear you calling
No, I will not answer

The sun may shine
Out to your mouth, dear
And the wind may blow
Right through my ear

Though I hear you calling
Oh, I will not answer
Though I hear you calling
But I will not answer

Calling and I broke your code
I will not answer, I will not answer
I will not answer, I will not answer
I will not answer, I will not answer
I will not answer

Though I hear you calling
I will not answer
Though I hear you calling
But I will not answer

And I will not answer
And I broke your code
Um, broke your code
Yeah, umm

Though I hear you calling
And the sun is shining
I will not answer
Right through your tooth, dear

The way we plan it
It’s an extra
Because it’s extra convenient
For just three dollars
