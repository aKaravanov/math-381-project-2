

Waterfall, nothing can harm me at all,
My worries seem so very small
With my waterfall.

I can see my rainbow calling me
Through the misty breeze
Of my waterfall.

Some people say day-dreaming's
For all the, huh, lazy minded fools
With nothing else to do.

So let them laugh, laugh at me,
So just as long as I have you
To see me through,
I have nothing to lose 'long as I have you.

Waterfall, don't ever change your ways.
Fall with me for a million days,
Oh, my waterfall.
