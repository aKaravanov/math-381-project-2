I'm looking all around
Well, I'm looking out my belly button window
And I see a whole lot of frowns
And I'm wondering if they don't want me around

What seems to be the fuzz out there?
Just what seems to be the hang?
'cause you know if ya just don't want me this time around,
Yeah I'll be glad to go back to spirit land
And even take a longer rest,
Before I'm coming down the chute again
Man, I sure remember the last time, baby
They were stlll hawkin' about me then
So if you don't want me now,
Make up your mind, where or when
If you don't want me now,
Give or take, you only got two hundred days
'cause I ain't coming down this way too much more again

You know they got pills for ills and thrills and even spills
But I think you're just a little too late
So I'm coming down into this world, daddy
Regardless of love and hate
And I'm gonna sit up in your bed, mama
And just a grin right in your face
And then I'm gonna eat up all your chocolates,
And say 'i hope I'm not too late'

So if there's any questions,
Make up your mind
'cause you better give or take
Questions in your mind
Give it a take,
You only got two hundered days

Way up into this womb
Looking all around
Sure's dark in here
And I'm looking out my belly button window
And I swear I see nothing but a lot of frowns
And I'm wondering if they want me around
