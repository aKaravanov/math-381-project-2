You don’t love me , you just want me.
So let’s make it baby, so I can leave.
You don’t need me. You just want to bleed me.
So take out your dagger, and cut me free, cut me free.
Cut me free.
Hey.
Hey!
You don’t love me, you just want to suffocate me
So hand me your blankets and take your dirty sheets
Dirty sheets, yeah
Take your dirty sheets
Well I must admit that you can be a pretty good artist
But I’ve never seen that smile painted all across your face.
Baby, baby on your
Baby on your face
Baby on your face
Oh I do declare you should be a rocket
You get me spaced out, laid out, look at the sun fade out.
And you almost made me leave my faith outside.
Hey, look at ya, all lovey-dovey when you mess around with that needle.
Well I
I wonder how would your loving be other-wise.
I wonder just how would your loving be, other-wise.
Well dig this brother.
I’m gonna spank your hands and I’m gonna throw away your stupid needle
I’m gonna try to make love straight, for the very first and last time.
Slow it down sugar, unless you in a hurry to die
You don’t love me girl, you just want to hurt me.
So let’s hurry and get this scene over so can marry up with that old sweet.
You don’t need me, you just wanna see me watch you, run after that suicide ball
Bouncin’ across the freeway
Bang, bang! Shoot, shoot
As long as you’re yourself girl, I’ll try not to give a hoot.
Oh, yeah, yes, slow down
Bang, bang! Shoot, shoot.
Slow down, slow down, slow down.
