I know what I want
But I just don't know
How to go about getting it

Feeling, sweet feeling
Drops from my Fender's fingers
Manic depression has a-captured my soul

Woman so weary
The sweet cause in vain
You make love
You break love
It's a—all the same
When it's—
When it's over

Music sweet music
I wish I could caress, caress, caress
Manic depression is a frustrating mess

Well, I think I'll go turn myself off and go on down
All the way down
Really ain't no use in me hanging around
In a your kind of scene

Music sweet music
I wish I could caress, and kiss, kiss
Manic depression is a frustrating mess

Music sweet music
Music
Depression
