

She walks with a bell-clock round her neck,
So the hippies think she's in with time
Her hair glistens like robins on a deck
Branches attack me from her neck

She's so fine
She's so very, very fine

Another verse I can't find lyrics to

When I veer I get so near
But so far far far away
Listen to me today.

We united just beside a leaf
The ground was hard underneath, her, her
She's so fine.
