What's in my heart, and why I love you so.
I love you baby like a miner loves gold.
Come on sugar, let the good times roll. hey!

So many people live in make believe,
They keep a lot a going up their sleeves.
But my love baby is no kind that folds.
Come On Baby, let the good times roll.
(Let the good times roll).

ah baby, come on and let daddy fill your soul.
baby, let the good times roll.
hey!

A love is nice if it's understood
It's even nicer when you're feelin' good
You got me flippin' like flag on a pole
Come on sugar, let the good times roll

Hey! Yeah! Let the good times roll!
feel me baby! Come on, good times roll!
come on and let me fill your soul, 
hey, let the good times roll
