All I could see was me
Well I take my spirit and I crash my mirrors
Now the whole world is here for me to see
I said the whole world is here for me to see
Now I'm searchin' for my love to be
Hey!!

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah!!!

Rubber glass was all in my brain
Cotton screamin' crying in my head
Rubber glass was all in my brain
Just the thought of my dreams cut me in my bed
And just the thought of my dreams cut me in my bed
I said a makin' love was strange in my bed
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah!!!

All right
Ooo ooo
Yeah yeah yeah

Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
No place stumpin'
No place far
Can't find the floor
No where at all
See nothing but sunshine
All around

Love comes shinin' over the mountains
Love comes shinin' over the sea
Love won't shine on my baby
Then I'll know who's exactly for me
Lord, I'll know who'll be for me
In the meen time, which is a groovy time
