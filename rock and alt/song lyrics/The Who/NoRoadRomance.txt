You see the man of your dreams
You think his life's full of parties and love
But it's not what it seems
If you could see in his room right now
You'd see how much love is showed
There's never really any romance on the road

His forehead seems cut in two
By the crease in his brown
He chews his nails and he fidgets
Just tryin' to settle on down
The TV channels keep flippin'
His adrenaline slowed
There's never really any romance on the road, oh no

There's never romance on the road
Only frustration and overload
He could fall in love but he'd never know
For she's only riding and he's only hiding
He's sure to ask but she won't say,"No"
But there's never really any romance on the road

He was up in the bar straight-backed
Did you see him before?
Did he sign you his name?
Come with me, listenin' at his door
Hear himself so drunk calling home
Can't remember the code
You know, there's never really any romance on the road
Oh no, no, no

He's held some beautiful girls in his arms
But now he clutches his bunk
For all the good that they're doing him now
He might as well be a monk
For his memories ain't worth a thing
Till he's old and he's gone
And his past never quite catches up
The show's movin' on

Did he say he kept a picture
Of a blonde haired girl who'd been kind?
When he was last home, his own daughter
Brought it into his mind
Maybe closing bars and jets
Paid some debts that he owed
But there's never really any romance on the road

There's never romance on the road
Only frustration and overload
He's never learned a thing from the dust that blowed
On stage for an hour, on a laser beam tower
But you know he slept while the neon glowed
There's never really any romance on the road

There's never romance on the road
Only frustration and overload
He could fall in love but he'd never know
For she's only riding and he's only hiding
He's sure to ask but she won't say, "No"
There's never really any romance on the road
