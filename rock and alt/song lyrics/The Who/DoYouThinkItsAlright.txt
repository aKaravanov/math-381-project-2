To leave the boy with Uncle Ernie?
Do you think it's alright
He's had a few too many tonight
Do you think it's alright? I think it's alright

I'm your wicked Uncle Ernie
I'm glad you won't see or hear me
As I fiddle about, fiddle about, fiddle about

Your mother left me here to mind you
Now I'm doing what I want to
Fiddling about, fiddling about, fiddle about

Down with the bedclothes
Up with your nightshirt
Fiddle about, fiddle about, fiddle about

Fiddle about, fiddle about, fiddle about

You won't shout as I fiddle about
Fiddle about, fiddle about, fiddle about
Fiddle about, fiddle about, fiddle about

Fiddle about, fiddle about, fiddle about
Fiddle about, fiddle about, fiddle about

Fiddle, fiddle, fiddle
