

I live in an apartment on the ninety-ninth floor of my block,
And I sit at home looking out the window, imagining the world has stopped.

Then in flies a guy who's all dressed-up just like a Union Jack
And says I've won five pounds if I have his kind of detergent pack.

I said, "Hey! You! Get off of my cloud!
Hey! You! Get off of my cloud!
Hey! You! Get off of my cloud!
Don't hang around
'Cause two's a crowd
On my cloud, baby!"

The telephone is ringing
I say, "Hi, it's me. Who is it there on the line?"
A voice says, "Hi, hello. How are you?"
Well, I guess I'm doin' fine.

He says, "It's three AM. There's too much noise.
Don't you people ever wanna go to bed?
Just 'cause you feel so good,
Do you have to drive me out of my head?"

I said, "Hey! You! Get off of my cloud!
Hey! You! Get off of my cloud!
Hey! You! Get off of my cloud!
Don't hang around
'Cause two's a crowd
On my cloud, baby."

I was sick and tired, fed up with this
And decided to take a drive downtown.
It was so very quiet and peaceful.
There was nobody, not a soul around.

I laid myself out, I was so tired
And I started to dream.
In the morning the parking tickets were just like a flag
Stuck on my window screen.

I said, "Hey! You! Get off of my cloud!
Hey! You! Get off of my cloud!
Hey! You! Get off of my cloud!
Don't hang around
'Cause two's a crowd
On my cloud

Hey! You! Get off of my cloud!
Hey! You! Get off of my cloud!
Hey! You! Get off of my cloud!
Don't hang around,
Baby, two's a crowd
On my cloud."
