Some say you won't
Some say you do
Some say you don't
But I know
I know what you will do
You gotta treat me, baby, just like I treat you

Some say you can
Some say you can't
Some say you is
Some say you ain't
But I know
I know what you will do
You gotta treat me, baby, just like I treat you

If I give you little
You can give it back
If I give you lots
I know what you like
But I know
I know what you will do
You gotta treat me, baby, just like I treat you

Some say you fun
Some say you sad
Some say you hot
Some say you bad
But I know
I know what you've been through
You gonna treat me, baby, just like I treat you
