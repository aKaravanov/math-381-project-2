

I'm blue and lonesome as a man want be
I'm blue and lonesome yeah, as a man can be
I don't have headaches over myself
My love has gone away from me

Baby, please come back to me
Baby, please come home to me
Yes, my heart is full of misery
Baby, you won't be sweet to me

I'm gonna cast my trouble
Down in the deep blue see
I'm gonna cast my trouble, yeah
Down in the deep blue see
Where the whales and the fishes
Have no fuss over me
