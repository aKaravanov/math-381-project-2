You better get you somebody, put you down
Better let her go, just as quick as you can
You know that hoodoo girl, she a hoodoo the hoodoo man

You know my woman got me on a wonder at somethin' I can't understan'
Now I look at her runnin' with some other man
After all I did, everything in this world I can
You know that hoodoo girl, she a hoodoo the hoodoo man

Well, blow your harmonica, son. Yes, she got me hoodoo

She take all my money and spend it all over town
when I want to love her, man, she ain't can be found
I walk and cry, dryin' tears away with my hand
You know that hoodoo girl, she a hoodoo the hoodoo man
