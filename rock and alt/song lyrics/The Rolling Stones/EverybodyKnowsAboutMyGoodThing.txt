And he mentioned your name
Seems like everybody
Everybody knows about my good thing

Call the plumber darling
There must be a leak in my drain
Seems like everybody
Everybody knows about my good thing

I was talking to my neighbour
About the way you wear your hair
They say you must have a lot of children
Because the milk man is always there

Call the plumber darling
There must be a leak in my drain
Seems like everybody
Everybody knows about my good thing

I was talking to the butcher
He said you always look so neat
I guess that's why my freezer
Is always full of meat

Call the plumber darling
There must be a leak in my drain
It seems like everybody, everybody
Everybody knows about my good thing

Everybody, I said everybody knows about my...
Everybody knows about my good thing...
Everybody knows knows that, nobody wants to be my woman...
Nobody wants to be, oh no, no...

Call the plumber darling...
There must be a leak in my drain...
Yeah!
It seems like everybody, everybody, everybody
Everybody knows about my good thing
