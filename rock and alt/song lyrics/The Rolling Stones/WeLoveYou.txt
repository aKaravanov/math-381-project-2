We don't care if you only love, 'We'

We love you, we love you
We hope that you will love, 'We' too
We love, 'They', we love, 'They'
We want you to love, 'They' too

We don't care if you hound, 'We'
And love is all around, 'We'
Love can't get our minds off
We love you, we love you

You will never win, 'We'
Your uniforms don't fit, 'We'
We forget the place we're in
'Cause we love you, we love you of course, we do

I love you, I love you
And I hope that you won't prove wrong too
We love you, we do
We love you, we do
