A little rain fallin', the little clock keep away the time
Well, a little rain keep a-fallin', on this little love of mine

Little flowers open, the little birds keep a-singin' tune
Little flowers open, little birds keep-a singin' tune
I would like to love you baby, underneath the shinin' moon
