

Lyin' in my plastic bed,
Thinkin' how things weren't so cool to me.
My baby likes to shoot pool,
I Like lyin' naked in my bedroom.
Tyin' on the dinosaur tonight,
It used to be so cool too.

Now I've got the needle,
And I can shake,
but I can't breath.
I take it away, but I want more and more.
One day I'm gonna lose the war.
