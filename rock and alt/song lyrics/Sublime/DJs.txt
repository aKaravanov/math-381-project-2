Start talkin trash and we'll come with my smith & wesson
A little competition comes my way but it always winds up the same,
"the stone that the builder refuse shall be the head cornerstone"

Ain't nothin wrong, ain't nothing right
But still I set and lie awake all night
All of the d.j.s surely have taken a lesson
Try talkin trash and we'll come with a smith & wesson

Enough d.j.s come with enough style
but when I bus my lyrics we all Know it's wicked-wily.
Ain't nothin wrong, ain't nothing right
But still I set and lie awake all night

You better strap with the gat
If you wanna walk with me, bound to come down
With the new stylee, rockin rubadub know as reggae music
Gotta come down with some new lyrics
It just ain't nothing, it's been a real long time

Ain't nothin wrong, ain't nothing right
But still I set and lie awake all night
Rubadub blender a new mixer
I am the one with d.j. with enough flavor
Hear the dub and say lord have his grilled cheese.
I ain't Jamaican, but I ain't no freak
Caught the man eno with the one pound bag o' tweak
And called him ghost rider everytime you see him he fulfill the danger

Ain't nothin wrong, ain't nothing right
But still I set and lie awake all night
Dred gotta a job to do and he might fulfill his mission
To see his pain would be his greatest ambition
We will survive in this world of competition
To make sure that till the ..is done

I won't wait so long
For you
Stop your messin around,
Better think of your future
Time to straighten right out or you'll wind up in jail
