

The time has come, to reach a new realization 'tween me and you,
time to clear the rumors, sensations, and things that just are not true.

Well I thought I heard you behind me,
with a knife poised for my back.
It's quite clear that I'm back in the swing of the living,
although I might not be on the right track.

Oh, thought I might drown but its hard to keep a good man down
town's where I'll find you, through some ill-gotten hand.
Although I never listen girl, I damn well understand.
And you think, I'm so damn feeble.
I can't see through your lies, your just a crock of shit,
with a pretty smile, and I refuse to compromise.

Oh, your giving me such a heavy, heavy, heavy load.

You may hold some vision of truth, if truth can be found in a lie.
Maybe some grain of inspiration, for a song that's deep inside.

Oh, tears running down your face,
Screaming to look you in the eye.
Well I'm looking straight at your twisted face,
and it's enough to make me cry.

Oh, passions they're for those that want to,

pay the price of loving you,
in more ways than one.
Wrapped around your finger,
but I think my time has come,
but I never can be too sure,
cuz I like to have a little fun.

Oh, what fun it would be to blow my mind and fall into the sun.
A mind is a precious thing to taste.
