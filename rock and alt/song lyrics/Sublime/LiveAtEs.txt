As she bends my body aches if she'd walk in I would say:
I'm on the mic doin things you like
The name is ras M.G. and I'm a treat you right
Cause all the ladies and me we both agree that I'm going down in world history

uh-uh elected, my rhymes will be perfected.
the mighty MC's will be dissected and rejected
I am the most impressive- aspective and progressive-
motivating, innovating, chillin and digested
Its obvious as ever it will be specialized
Your trying to proclaim-uh- cant be compromised
I am a fresh MC
As you can plainly see
You won't regret a DJ fresh Im sure you'll soon agree
So take a seat n' feel the beat of coarse it is OK, Uh-Uh

Oh she makes my body ache and you know I paid for more
I won't flake or perpetrate, I won't front no funky whore
Don't get me wrong I'm just singing my song
I'm just like you I like to ball my freaks all night long
Not only do I rhyme I also cut so nice they call me delight

My name is eric I have nothing to say
because I am not a fucking d.j.
And if you want to talk to me, then you'll have to talk to my man Bradlee

5000 G, we outta here, peace, unity.
