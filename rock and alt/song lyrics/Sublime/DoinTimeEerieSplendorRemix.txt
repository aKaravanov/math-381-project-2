Me and my girl we got this relationship

All locked down like a penitentiary
She spreads her lovin all over and when she gets home there's none left for me

Take a spiff of sinsemilla make it run through your brain
Me and Sublime we sound 1 - the same
Two lions into the jungle that they just can't tame
So bring all your people
And bring it
You better take your lovin and fling it
You better bring your lovin home
Come and love your maximo
24/7 say me can't sink so low

My burning sun will some day rise
And what am I gonna be doin for a wife
I said I'm gonna play with myself
Show them now we've come off the shelf
