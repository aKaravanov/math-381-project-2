

I don't wanna go and party
I don't wanna shoot the pier
I don't wanna take the doggie out for a walk
I don't wanna look at naked chicks and drink beer
I don't wanna do a bong load and go and wrench on the car
I don't wanna go and hose the dogshit down
Cause i ain't even gonna get out of bed
Keep on skankin' ronnie skank the night away
But the time is comin' for us all to pay
I don't wanna watch no porno
I don't wanna play guitar
I don't wanna spank the monkey
I don't wanna go down to the corner bar
Ain't even got to listen to all the stupid shit you got to say
I don't wanna do a god damn thing
I ain't gonna make my bed today
I don't wanna eat burritos or read about o.j.
Ain't gonna get a head rush cause i ain't gettin out of bed today
