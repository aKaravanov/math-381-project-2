So hit me with music.
Hit me with music, now, yeah.
Hit me with music.
Brutalize me with music.
Trenchtown rockers they don't watch that.
Trenchtown rockers give me your Jah.
Trenchtown rockers then watch your children cry.
Cuz' you've got to tell Jah why you're movin'

Kingston town, movin'
Kingston town.

One little thing I've found,
is that you can't fool Jah, I know.
Cuz there moving, yes I'm moving.
I said one good thing, one good thing,
when it hits you you feel no pain.
One good thing about music, when it hits you,
you feel no pain.
