Every day I love him a little bit more,
a little bit more, a little bit more.
Every day I love him just a little bit more,
and he loves me the same.
[Brad]
Every day I love her a little bit more,
a little bit more, a little bit more,
Every day I love her just a little bit more,
and she loves me the same.
[both]
Baby if ya wanna get on, baby if ya wanna get off.
It makes no sense at all, I saw red. I saw red. I saw red.
One more secret lover that I shot dead.
[Brad]
Every day I wake up, just a little bit more,
feelin' like a dog in the yard because it's just how we are.
[Gwen]
And every day I wonder if it's over,
when I wake up I realize no it isn't, and break down the wall.
[Brad]
You say it's black but I just can't believe you.
[Gwen]
And if I say it's white say I'm just trying to deceive you.
[Brad]
And baby, I'm aware of the high and the low,
and I'll be waiting for you in the middle, but I just lack control.
[both]
Baby if ya wanna get low, baby if ya wanna get high.
It makes no sense at all, I saw red. I saw red.
One more secret lover that I shot dead.
[Brad]
Girls don't go crazy, girls don't go crazy, oh girls don't crazy when the men use you.
[Gwen]
Women hold your men tight, if it makes you feel all right,
It's your own life.
