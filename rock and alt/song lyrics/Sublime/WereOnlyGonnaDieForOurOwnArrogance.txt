As modernman took control
There mind's weren't all the same
And to conquer was their goal
So he built his great empire
And he slaughtered his own kind
He died a confused man
And killed himself in his own mind,

[Spoken - only in original Skunk Records version]
"Punks are running wild in the streets and nobody anywhere seems to know what to do and there's no end to it. Its like everything everywhere is going crazy so we dont go out anymore, we sit in the house [with reverb] and slowly the world we're living in is getting smaller and all we say is please and please leave us alone in our living rooms, just leave us alone. Well im not going to leave you alone." [another voice] "There's gotta be somthing different"

We're only gonna die for our own arrogance,
that's why we might as well take our time
