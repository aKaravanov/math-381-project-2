

She wears a tight skirt but it won't rip or tear.
When I went out with her she had extensions in her hair.
She got style and she got the cat moves.
You're gonna keep the beat fun because she's coming after you.
I ain't high I won't lose
I might be lookin for attention but I'm just not gonna lose
It's Friday night and there's going to be another chick on my tip
But it won't be you baby.
Got one more trick up my sleeve
One more thing to say to you before I leave.
Yo girl you don't mean a thing to me
and if you thought you ever did you were high on things..
But I'm not lying gonna lose a Goddamn thing tonight
I said Friday night there's going to be another chick on my tip
But it won't be you baby.
Oh if you change your ways I would lay down any time with you... with you
But I fear one more slip and this will go right
But I'm not ready to say goodbye
Because first I got a couple of tails I'm gonna kick it on down your butthole. High, low.
Run for attention but I just can't lose
Friday night there's going to be another chick on my tip
But it won't be me but, oh
Oh if you change your ways I would lay down anytime with her... with her
Got one my, my, my I know we had a couple of times.
But I'm ready to go
I'm gonna kick it on down your butthole. High, low.
I'm not high on booze
I'm on a run for attention but I just can't lose
Friday night there's going to be another slip on my dick but it won't be me
But oh, oh, if you'll change your ways
I would lay down anytime with her
With her....
