

be it your guide is so much to love 
you can hide your love its true 
it's the freedom game 
you can see it every day, 
'cause your freedom ain't free 

come on down, i know how 
i'm gonna make you so feared. 

don't you know it ain't no thing before 
so don't take more than you need 
it's somethin' that i'll do later, 
now it's over 
it's not my fault 

under my voodoo 

it's under my voodoo 


pray that i leave you high and dry 
pray you can make me cry 

if your faded, put it in my prayers 
i damn my feeling, i roll on 
i tell you the truth 

it aint no thing 
if you wanna get real dry.. one thing though 

gonna kill for it, more, more, it's not my fault, it's got me, 

and i'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone 

under my voodoo 

under my voodoo 

it's under my voodoo 

lord, hey, voodoo 
lord, hey, voodoo 
what'cho wanna wanna wanna do
