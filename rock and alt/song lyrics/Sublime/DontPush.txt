Chased out with a knife
With a face like Bob Marley
And a mouth like a motor bike

Oh well the bars are always open
And the time is always right
And if God's good word goes unspoken
The music goes all night

And it goes

If I were Bob Marley I'd say, "Could you be loved?"
And if I was Half Pint or with my Lord up above
If I was Mike Tyson I would look for a fight
And if I was a Boomtown Rats I would be staying up all night
If I was the king Ad-Rock I would get stupid dumb
If rhymes were Valiums I'd be comfortably numb

If I had a shotgun, you know what I'd do
I'd point that shit straight at the sky
And shoot heaven on down for you

Because the bars are always open
And the time is always right
And if God's good word goes unspoken
The music goes all night

And it goes

I want a lover, but I can't find the time
I want a reason, but I can't find the rhyme
And I wanna start some static, but I can't afford
To get slammed to the ground like I fell off my skateboard, hey
Nowadays as clear as you please
Get strapped with protection or strap with disease

Laughter, it's free
Any time just call me

When you're down with Sublime
You get funky fresh hits
You get nothing

Stolen from an Africa land
I was chased out of the bar
I saw my best friend tonight
So don't push me too far

I'm gonna run come down with the new lyrics
Get hip get hip don't slip you knuckle heads
Racism is schism on a serious tip
You don't believe me that I go and bust your lip

Higher the mountain, it hard to climb
Rougher the rhythm, then it must be sublime
Listen yellow lover yeah they're right on time
We got Cricket with the quickness and the bass line

Go and raid the sound and tell the people the news
Oh, hey
Tell them reggae music is on the loose
Here I am, like a raging storm with a brand new style and a unique fashion
(I am from the place where the sun keeps shinin', shinin')
And good good vibes that keep on playing, playing

Them a fire one shot for peace equality
Come, come, them a come with a rougher stylee
Come, come, they no care about your reggae stylee
Come, come, if ya come with your reggae style

Them a fire one shot
Pump-pump, lick-a-shot
Them a fire two shots
Pump-pump, lick-a-shot
Them a fire three shots
Pump-pump, lick-a-shot
Them a hear about me rock
With me armor

Do a launch, then attack me with they armor
When they start counter-react me with they armor
Fear who are launch, them attack me with they armor
Me no start counter-reactin' them bigger
Hear me copy, tell you about this reggae stylee

Wait, hold up

People wanna come up and they want tell me
Smoking crack cocaine better than sinse
You're poppin' that shit
'Til we're sick of it
Tweakin' every weekend and we just can't take it
We don't want plastic
Bump
