"I wanna go to a party," that's what she said
Lonely, that's what I been

Here's my telephone number, call me
And to a party, a house party
Whole lotta people just rally round me
And love, she send a message of love

She said, "I love up the way you move, I love the way you rap," BAH BAH.
Ramona, please step back

Now she's my Ruca, I'm barely waiting for my hiena

She moved from Long Beach down to LA
Right now she selling oranges by the freeway
I wanna know, Ramona, am I the only one, tell me

And she said, "You're not the only one, but you're the best Bradley," BAH BAH.
And now I'm waiting for my Ruca and I barely pulled up with my hiena
I know tonight I'll be behind her, don't fuck around with my hiena.
