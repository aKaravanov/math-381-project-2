I swear, sometimes you're a whore
I swear, but I know there ain't no reason
'Cause everything is such a bore

Last night I had a dream, though it made me sick
Saw you in your bedroom sucking someone else's dick (my goodness!)
My friends all laughed, said it was my fault
Said it's time that it happened to me

But I know that the show was much more than a blow
So I'm waiting for the tide to get low
Waiting for the tide to get low

(Damn, now lick my balls)
(I said, fuck that, motherfucker, you bitin' it. Shit!)

If I was an ant crawling upon the wall
Tell me, baby, would it make no difference at all?
If I was a roach on a tree
Tell me would you smoke me?

Bright lights put me in a trance
But it ain't house music, makes me want to dance (word)
I don't gamble, but I bet
I'm gonna die if I don't get a cigarette
Hold just because I always play the mack
Put the monkey on my back.
