And Bradley's on the microphone with Ras M.G.
All the people in the dance will agree
That we're well qualified to represent the LBC
Me, and me, and Louie, will young run to the party
Dance to the rhythm it gets harder
(And we can do it like this, in the place to be)

Me and my girl we got this relationship
I love her so bad but she treats me like shit
On lockdown like a penitentiary
She spreads her lovin' all over
And when she gets home there’s none left for me

Summertime and the living's easy
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras M.G.
All people in the dance will agree
That we're well qualified to represent the LBC
Me, me and Louie, we gon' run to the party
Dance to the rhythm it gets harder
(And we can do it like this, in the place to be)

Oh take this veil from off my eyes
My burning sun will some day rise
So what am I gonna be doin' for a while?
Said I'm gonna play with myself
Show them now we've come off the shelf
So what?

Summertime and the living's easy

Evil
I've come to tell you that she's evil most definitely
Evil
Ornery scandalous and evil most definitely
The tension: it's getting hotter
I'd like to hold her head underwater

Me and my girl we got a relationship
Me and my girl we got a relationship
My girl. We got a relationship
oh, and my girl. We got a relationship

Take a tip, take a tip, take a tip, tip, tip from me
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras M.G.
All people in the dance will agree
That we're well qualified to represent the LBC
Me, la la Louie well everybody run to the rhythm it gets harder
(And we can do it like this, in the place to be)

Summertime, the living's easy
