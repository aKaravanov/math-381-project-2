And give it to a police man?
I wouldn't do that, I wouldn't do that
If I did that would you say, "Sir, come down and put the charge on me"?
I wouldn't do that, no I wouldn't do that

I'm not a fool to hurt myself
But I was innocent to what they done to me
They were wrong, they were wrong

Give it to me one time
Oh give it to me, yeah
Give it to me two times
Give it to me three times
Give it to me four times

Oh 54-46 was my number? What's my number now?
Right now somebody else has that number
One more time 54-47 was my number? What's my number now?
Right now somebody else has that number

Say boom, say, one go with him up, yes
Say boom, say, want keep him, keep him on his back, say
Say boom, say, me want to take off her dress, huh
Say boom, say, I've kissed and caressed

'Cause we're jilling and we're chilling in the club all night
We're jilling and we're chilling in the club all night
Hear the dogs, hear the beat, in the dog pound
DJ, Lord have his grilled cheese

Some jealous punk
Snuck up around my back
Tried to take a loving over me
Lord I got into a fist fight
And wound up in jail all night

Give it to me one time
Oh yes, ooh, my pussy
Give it to me two times
Give it to me three times
Give it to me four times

People listen up, don't stand too near
I got something that you all should hear
All lies, all the lies she told to me
Form a little part of history

I was always taught that boy meets girl
Fall in love get married and forget the world
Nine months later, the sweet baby's on the way
Kiss 'em on the cheek and life's OK

I don't feel no pain
I don't have no time
To listen to conflicting points of view
It's a crazy world to live alone
A ball and chain I call my own

People listen up, don't stand too close
I got something that you all should know
Holy matrimony is not for me
Rather die alone in misery

I was always taught that boy meets girl
Fall in love get married and forget the world
Nine months later the sweet baby's on the way
Isn't that what they used to say?

With a girl that you knew
And the bonds that we grew
Turned into a ball and chain

I step into the great unknown
A ball and chain I call my own

Crazy world to live alone

With a girl that you knew
And the bonds that we grew
Turned into a ball and chain

I step into the great unknown
A ball and chain I call my own

Because marriage doesn't work in the world today
It's an institution that is in decay
And if I have love I wish to portray
I will surely find another way

Because I was always taught that boy meets girl
Fall in love get married and forget the world
Nine months later the sweet baby's on the way
Kiss 'em on the cheek and life's OK!

I don't feel no pain
I don't have no time
To listen to conflicting points of view
I step into the great unknown
With a ball and chain I call my own
