

It's recording?

...Clock says half past one
I have no sunglasses
As I step into the sun
I know I did something
Lord what could it be
Woke up in the morning
And all my friends hate me

She got the Eye of Fatima
In the wall of his room
Three bottles of Tequila
Three cats and a broom
He got a 15-year-old angel
And she's all dressed in black
He got 15 bindles of cocaine
Tied up in a sack

This here's a government experiment
And we're drivin' like hell
We'll get some cowboys on acid
And stay in motels
We gonna eat up some wide open spaces
Like it was the top of the Nile
The hands on the clock are gonna be here
A while

An eye of Eye of Fatima
In the wall of the hotel room
And cowboys on acid
Are like Egyptian cartoons
No one ever conquered Wyoming
From the left or from the right
Just stay in the hotel room
Stay up all night
