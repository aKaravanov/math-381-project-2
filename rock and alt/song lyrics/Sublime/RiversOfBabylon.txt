

By the rivers of Babylon,
Where he sat down,
And there he went
When he remembered Zion.

Over the wicked carry us away.
Captivity required from us a song.
How can we sing King Alpha's song in a strange land?

So let the words of our mouth
And the meditation of our heart
Be acceptable in thy sight
Over I.

By the rivers of Babylon
Where he sat down,
And there he went,
When he remembered Zion.

Over the wicked carry us away.
Captivity required from us a song.
How can we sing King Alpha's song in a strange land?
How can we sing King Alpha's song in a strange land?
