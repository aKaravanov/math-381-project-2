

My place is not a home, don't make no difference
But I have found that I need a place to stay
I never listen to what the landlord man say
You should've seen the flops in my house
We were jumping on walls and kicking ceilings
Now a days people listen to me, when I say.."GET OUT"

Hold me and don't let go
Makes no difference that your a ho
Cause I need a place to stay and though disease was just the price I paid.
In days of old that how it used to be, oh yes indeed.
That girl is dead to me now and I say .."GET OUT"

All the time the people want to know the meaning of the word Sublime
It ain't anarchist, it's the shit you missed
We get the minute man loop and add a peni twist
We know you mutha that this is the shit that you put in the box And say damn it's a hit
And to all the radios and the tv shows
Cause we don't kiss no ass or kick down free shows
What you get is the kind no econo gang or cess with yellow lover on the d-r-u-m-s

Let the lovin take a hold over me
Let the lovin take a hold over me
"Cause all I see is your fussin' and fightin'
1992 so lets all start uniting
Put your hands together be the best you can be
Let this jam take us to 1993
Stay positive and the love will come back to me
