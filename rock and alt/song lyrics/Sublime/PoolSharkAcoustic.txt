

Lying in my plastic bed,
thinking how things weren't so cool to me.
My baby likes to shoot pool,
I like lying naked in my bedroom, tying on the dinosaur tonight,
it used to be so cool.

Now I got that needle, I can shake, but I can't breathe.
Take it away, but I want more and more.
One day I'm gonna lose the war.
