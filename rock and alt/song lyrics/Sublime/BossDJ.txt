

There's a steel train comin' through,
I would take it if I could. And I would not lie to you
because Sunday morning soon will come
when things would be much easier to say
upon the microphone like a boss DJ
when I would work upon the sea like it was dry land.
The boss DJ ain't nothin' but a man.

No trouble no fuss, .. I know why.
It's so nice, I wanna hear the same song twice.
It's so nice, I wanna hear the same song twice.

Rumors flyin' all over town, but it's just stones and sticks.
'Cause on the microphone is where I go to get my fix.
Just let the lovin' take ahold, 'cause it will if you let it.
I'm funky, not a junky, but I know where to get it.

[Chorus]

Oo-we girl, oo-we girl
There really ain't no time to waste, really ain't no time to hate.
Ain't got no time to waste, time to hate.
Really ain't time to make the time go away.
So mister DJ, don't stop the music, I wanna know,
Are you feelin' the same way too?
I wanna rock with you girl, oo-girl.
Don't stop.

[Chorus]
