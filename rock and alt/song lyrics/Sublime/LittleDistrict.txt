

Oh in a Little District,
In a neighborhood,
People movin' swift,
Like they think they should

A word from your mouth,
Your lights get knocked out
A blast to your lip,
And later you move and slip
And if you have to don't trip

I don't know how they manage
But believe me Mr., they do
If you ever live there,
You just listen and don't be no fool

No one ask no question,
No one tell no lie
Listen to me people ,
The reason why
