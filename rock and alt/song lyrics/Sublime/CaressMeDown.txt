[Glad to meet you. My name is Bradley]
I'm hornier than Ron Jeremy
And if you wanna get popped in your knee
Just wipe that look off your batty face

You hate me 'cause I got what you need
A pretty little daughter that we call "Mexi"
And if you wanna get beat physically
It will be over in a minute if ya

So she told me to come over, and I took that trip
And then she pulled out my mushroom tip
And when it came out, it went drip, drip, drip
I didn't know she had the G.I. Joe kung-fu grip

And it went
And the girl caress me down
And that's the lovin' sound
It went
And the girl caress me down
And that's the lovin' sound

When I kiss Mexi, she makes me feel horny
'Cause I'm the type of lover with the sensitivity
When she kiss my neck and tickle me fancy
The right kind of loving on Sunday morning

En el otro lado, es donde viví
Con mijita, que se llama Mexi
Y su hermana, si me quieré
Y ahorita, tenemos un bebé

[English translation:
"On the other side is where I lived
With my girl, who's name is Mexi
And her sister; she wants me
And now we have a baby"]

Sus padres, sus tios, me trataron matar
[Her parents, her uncles, they tried to kill me]
But they did not get too far
Un poco después tuvé que regresar
[A little while later I had to come back]
Con un chingo de dinero
[With a shit-load of money]
'Cause you know I'm a star

Yo fui a Costa Rica
Para tomar y sufear
Platicaba con la raza
[English translation:
"I went to Costa Rica
To drink and surf
I'd talk to the race"]
'Cause they know who we are

Sí no me dió cuenta
[If you didn't pay attention to me]
Then I bet you never will
You must be a muñeca
[You must be a doll]
If you're still standing still

And we ball
And the girl caress me down
And that's the lovin' sound
We go
And the girl caress me down
And that's the lovin' sound

Me gusta mi reggae
[I like my reggae]
Me gusta punk rock
[I like punk rock]
Pero la cosa que me gusta más es panochita
[But the thing I like most is pussy]

Pon la nalga en la aire if you know who you are
Pon la nalga en la aire y empieza gritar
[English translation:
"Put your ass in the air if you know who you are
Put your ass in the air and start to scream"]

No tenga miedo, I'm your papí
Take your chones, y los manden a mí
Levanta, levanta, tienes que gritar
Levanta, levanta, tienes que bailar

[English translation:
"Don't be scared, I'm your daddy
Take your panties and send them to me
Get up, get up, you have to scream
Get up, get up, you have to dance"]

Because the girl caress me down
And that's the lovin' sound
And the girl caress me down
That's the lovin' sound

And the girls caress me down
That's the lovin' sound
