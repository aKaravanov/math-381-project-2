Getting all wet but I got me a brainstorm
Why don't we hide in the trunk of this tree for a while
And were getting so close and so warm that you're making me smile
Well you're making me wish we could stay here for more than a while

Well the rain has been over for two or three hours
We're gonna stay with the trees and the flowers
Why don't we stay here 'til 1974
And I look at the sky and I wish it would rain some more
And you're making me feel 
like I never felt before

This memory I can't erase
The raindrops on your face look so inviting
I know that love I can't resist the way 
You part your lips is so exciting 
Inviting

You and me caught in the heart of a rainstorm
Getting all wet but I got me a brainstorm
Why don't we hide in the trunk of this tree for a while
And were getting so close and so warm that you're making me smile
Well you're making me wish we could stay here for more than a while
Yes you're making me wish we could stay here for more than a while
