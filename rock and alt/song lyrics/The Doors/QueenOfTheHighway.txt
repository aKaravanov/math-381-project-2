

She was a princess, Queen of the Highway 
Sign on the road said: "Take us to Madre" 
No one could save her, save the blind tiger 
He was a monster, black dressed in leather 
She was a princess, Queen of the Highway 

Now they are wedded, she is a good girl 
Naked as children out in a meadow 
Naked as children, wild as can be 
Soon to have offspring, start it all over 

Start at all over 

American boy, American girl 
Most beautiful people in the world! 
Son of a frontier Indian Swirl 
Dancing through the midnight whirl-pool, formless 
Hope it can continue a little while longer
