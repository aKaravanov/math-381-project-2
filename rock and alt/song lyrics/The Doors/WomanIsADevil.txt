Walking side by side.
Me and the devil,
Gonna take you on a long and evil ride.
The woman is a devil,
That's what I've been told.
Woman is a devil,
That's what I've been told.
She'll take all your money,
Then she'll spend all your gold.
All right.
Well she feel like dying.
Only twenty-one.
Well she feel like dying,
But she's only twenty-one.
She's not the only,
She's not the only one.
All right, all right, all right.
All right, all right.
Gonna save the whole world,alright.
