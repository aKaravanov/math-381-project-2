

Someday soon, someday soon
Familiar freaks will fill your living room
Rugs lash out their lizard tongues
You're not getting young, you're not getting young

But you're going to die
And you're going to be needing all of your eyes

You'll be all alone
When the animals cry
All by yourself
In some infancy's lie

Someday soon, someday soon
Television bleeding like a harvest moon
Flush the scissors down the hole
You're getting old, you're getting old

And I hate to remind you but you're going to die
And you're going to be needing all of your lies

You'll be all alone
When the animals cry
All by yourself
In some infancy's lie

Someday soon
Someday soon
Someday soon
Someday soon
