[Intro:]
You told me your whole life story in a few shorts
All the while, I never knew the tone of your voice
A half an hour, I ramble on way too much
(My love)
Alone with my own thoughts
(My love)
(1, 2, 3, come on-) Enough is enough

[Verse 1:]
There's a plain way to call it, but it's never that obvious for me
I'm in a communion, I got needs
The combination of all my life's complaints and a few strong dreams
(Come on, you f-)
I don't remember the parking lot
I just remember it's all the same
(Come on, you f-)
(My love)
And it's all the same
(My love)

[Hook 1:]
1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me
1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me
1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me
1, 2, 3, come on-
(Remember it's all-)
1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me
1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me
1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me
1, 2, 3, come on-

[Verse 2:]
Bring the corners from left to right
I'm in the mode to take you to crossfade
Coming closer to midnight
And I'm wide awake
And ain't you afraid to fade?
Couldn't wait to get you naked on the first date
But you made me wait
So it takes one to make one
The compromise we made
Please believe me
I don't recall the parking lot
I just remember it's all the same
And it's all the same
It's all the s-

[Hook 2:]
1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me
1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me
1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me
1, 2, 3, come on-
(My love)
Come on, you feel me
(My love)
Come on-
(Remember the parking lot)
Come on, you feel me (My love)
Come on, you feel me
1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me (My love)
1, 2, 3, come on-
Come on, you feel me (My love)
Come on, you feel me (It's all the same)
1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me (My love)
1, 2, 3, come on-

[Outro:]
1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me
Come on, you f-
1, 2, 3
Feel me
(Have mercy, baby!
Can you dig it? Can you dig it?)
