On i95, at the turn

I ever tell you 'bout the time I, drivin' down the I-9?
Lady in the passenger, smokin' on La-La
Put your blunt up in the ash tray
And get your hair up out the way
Just keep your headlow
Just keep your headlow
Me and little Joonie sittin' in a movie
Soon as the lights out, she gon' pull the pipe out
She don't want no popcorn, she just want her mouth on me
Just keep your headlow
Just keep your headlow

Ooh, she pulls my coat and so I have to slow it down, do it simple
She says pull over, uh oh, I slow it down, do it simple
My windows foggin' up, I see them watchin' us
We're almost home, better keep your headlow
Better keep your headlow

I ever tell you 'bout the time when I, runnin' down the 9 mile?
Lady with the Puma sneaks
Sit up on me, head towel
Rippin' locks with the right bomb
Hey, don't stop, baby, keep goin'
Just keep your headlow
Just keep your headlow
Tears fallin' down my left cheek
Baby hit the nerve like a Pepsi
You can't breathe when I'm neck deep
I take it out but you just wanna finish me
Everywhere we go, we make a scene
We hit it long, long as you keep
Just keep your headlow
Just keep your headlow

Ooh, she pulls my coat and so I have to slow it down, do it simple
She says pull over, uh oh, I slow it down, do it simple
My windows foggin' up, I see them watchin' us
We're almost home, better keep your headlow
Better keep your headlow

She pulls my coat and so I have to slow it down, do it simple
She says pull over, uh oh, I slow it down, do it simple
My windows foggin' up, I see them watchin' us
We're almost home...
