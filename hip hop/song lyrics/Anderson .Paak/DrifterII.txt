[Hook - Anderson Paak:]
Baby, your drifter is all I can be
But you don't stop me from floating up stream

[Verse 1 - Anderson Paak:]
Into the town about half past three
Taking a addy and try to bag a couple bitches
Fresh out the addies but I got a half a bleeze
A full tank of gas I just need a pot to piss in
Bottled water, Trident, cashews, and Swishers
Flirting with the workers
Bitch you could get it
Thumbing through my browsers
Power moves and pivots
Swimming in the fountain
Diving off the deep end

[Hook - Anderson Paak]

[Verse 2 - Anderson Paak:]
Momma you didn't say much but that was key
Real niggas do real things
Let your actions speak like [? Sireaz]
Unless they want action, in that case you swing
Young but I'll listen
Always made the best of life through life's givings
Always packed an extra pair of clean britches
Everyone's a star, gold is in the diggings
So with the bitch you bought I don't ball on extensions
Everyday a hustle dollar day
Thug holiday on my daddy grave
In the Grinch Who Stole Christmas

[Hook - Anderson Paak]

[Outro - Anderson Paak:]
Floating up stream
Baby, your drifter is all I can be
But you don't stop me from floating up stream
But you don't stop me from floating up stream
That's all I can be
If I sink I sink
