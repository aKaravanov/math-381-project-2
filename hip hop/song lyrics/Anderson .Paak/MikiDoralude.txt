[Mike Dora:]
I don't know, doesn't make a difference to me
My whole life is an escape, my whole life is this way, might drop into, set the whole thing up, pull out the bottom, turn, pull up into it, and shoot for my life, going for broke man
And behind me, all the shit goes over my back, the screaming parents, teachers, screaming teachers, police, priests, politicians, knee boarders, wind surfers
They're all going over the [?] into the reef, head first into the fucking reef, bwah, and I'm sure of my life
And when it starts to close out I pull out, to the bottom out, to the back, and I pick up another one and do the same damn thing
