[Verse 1:]
Take a walk
Before it gets dark
Little angel
There's no need to worry
Shouldn't be too painful
At last, I see the roses
West bound on a cold train
I'm headed home for the closing

[Verse 2:]
Take a walk
Before it gets dark
There's no need to worry
Shouldn't be too painful
At last, I see the roses
West bound on a cold train
I'm headed home for the closing

[Outro:]
Drifting towards the ocean
Some place where I can lay my head down
Are closing
