[Intro:]
Time never cares, if you're there or not there
All you ever needed was a simple plan
But you're doing well, I mean you're not dead
So let's celebrate while we still can

[Verse 1:]
I know what they say, I could give or care
They talk so much on me, I must be doing something right
I saw my son today, in the likeness of a full grown man
So I'll celebrate while I still can

[Hook:]
On a clear day you can see West LA, even downtown
I remember where I couldn't even see the point
Of stepping out the mother fucking house
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
I came to fix up the tree that's [?] came to far

[Verse 2:]
How many others have walked the same ground you have
You will be wise to pay attention to your old head
I spent the whole day throwing records in the deep end
So let's celebrate while we still can

[Verse 3:]
Captivated, the fruits of my family tree
Where would I be without you
What would you do without me
It would be a bad look talkin' bout what could of been
So let's celebrate while we still can

[Hook:]
On a clear day you can see West LA, even downtown
I remember where I couldn't see the point
But I got it figured out now
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
I came to fix up the tree that's [?] came to far

[Piano Riff]

[Verse 4:]
Do not be concerned about the money in your brother's hand
What's mine is yours
I thought you knew me better than that
I was under the impression that we all want the best of life
So let's celebrate while we still can

[Skit:]
The partnership of the board and the body of the fellow that is doing the maneuvers in the fluent directions with the-with this wave is what interests me. Now chaotic surfing, nervous surfing, and uh, surfing power has its merits. And I, uh, I can-it fascinates me. That's just not my direction. I can only speak for myself
