[Hook:]
I get the feelin' that ya might be
Did I turn you on? You can tell me if I'm wrong
But I'm feelin' that ya might be
And we ain't even smoke but you swear I got that dope
And I'm thinkin' you'd like to be
Every word I speak got you floatin' off your seat
And I'm knowin' that you like me
Oh you high baby, high baby

[Verse 1:]
Okay, the blunt is rolled up
Nobody lit it
Said even if we don't puff
Won't make a difference
My body's leaning to the right baby
You tell me 'go on and spend the night baby? '
No, I don't even know ya
I know enough to get you high baby

[Pre-Hook:]
I got about a half an ounce of that tree
Got about a half a cup of that lean
I said go on and kick your feet up
I'm a go ahead and twist the weed up
She said cool to say what I think
I said go and do what you feel
She said bend me over that sink
I said damn your wish is my will

[Hook:]
I get the feelin' that ya might be
Did I turn you on? You can tell me if I'm wrong
But I'm feelin' that ya might be
And we ain't even smoke but you swear I got that dope
And I'm thinkin' you'd like to be
Every word I speak got you floatin' off your seat
And I'm knowin' that you like me
Oh you high baby, high baby

[Verse 2:]
Okay, I'm feelin' so stuck
Laid up on the couch, got fingers in your mouth
Girl, bring it closer
Before my high comes down, my high comes down
Girl, I can barely keep my eyes open
You say you tryna get your spine blown in
No, I don't even know ya
I know enough to get you high floatin'

[Pre-Hook:]
I got about a half an ounce of that tree
Got about a half a cup of that lean
I said go on and kick your feet up
I'm a go ahead and twist the weed up
She said cool to say what I think
I said go and do what you feel
She said bend me over that sink
I said damn your wish is my will

[Breakdown:]
Feelin' that ya might be
Oh tell me are you high, baby
I get the feelin' that ya
Tell me you high as me?
Oh tell me are you high?
Tell me you high? Are you high, are you high as me?
Oh tell me are you high?
Tell me you are, tell me are you high as me?

[Hook:]
I get the feelin' that ya might be
Did I turn you on? You can tell me if I'm wrong
But I'm feelin' that ya might be
And we ain't even smoke but you swear I got that dope
And I'm thinkin' you'd like to be
Every word I speak got you floatin' off your seat
And I'm knowin' that you like me
Oh you high baby, high baby
