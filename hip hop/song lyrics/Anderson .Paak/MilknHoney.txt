[Intro:]
Nah-nah-nah, nah-nah

[Verse 1:]
Went from chicken shit ho to magnificent pro
Shoppin' bags at the grove, MCM on the coat
Had to clean up her nose, had to dream up some goals
Swimming in Fendi business that's probably owned
I was walking down 6th, she pulled up in a 6
She said "Hop in this whip, " I said "Bitch, you the feds"
She said "Baby, don't trip, " then she rolled me a spliff
Showed me pics of her kids, then she slid me some bread like

[Bridge:]
It's yours, babe, cause I got big money
So if you need something, don't be ashamed
It's yours, babe, cause you got big lovin'
So go and spend somethin', I said okay
I said okay (All I need... good love)
I said okay (Hey)
I said okay (All a nigga need, yeah... good love)
I said okay (Uh-huh)

[Hook:]
And now
I'm swimming in milk n' honey, I'm swimming in milk n' honey
Swi-swimming in milk n' honey, swimming in milk n' honey
I'm swimming in milk n' honey, swi-swimming in milk n' honey
Dick in this bitch's stomach (Spending this bitch's money)
I'm swimming in milk n' honey, I'm swimming in milk n' honey
Swi-swimming in milk n' honey, swimming in milk n' honey
I'm swimming in milk n' honey, swi-swimming in milk n' honey
Dick in this bitch's stomach (Spending this bitch's money)

[Verse 2:]
It's too good to be true, I ain't got nothin' to do
I got keys to the coupe, I just spent all this loot
She said "Get what you want, " she said "Live how you do
But If I catch you with other bitches, your throat - I'm a slit"
I said "It's yours, babe, I put your name on this dick"
But I was lyin' of course, I'm slammin' chick after chick
Soon as she gave me the Porsche, I bang her right on the strip
I copped some white on the 5th and pulled up right on a bitch like

[Bridge:]
It's yours, babe, cause I got big money
So if you need something, don't be ashamed
It's yours, babe, cause you got big lovin'
So go and spend somethin', I said okay
I said okay (All I need... good love)
I said okay (Hey)
I said okay (All a nigga need, yeah... good love)
I said okay (Uh-huh)

[Hook:]
And now
I'm swimming in milk n' honey, I'm swimming in milk n' honey
Swi-swimming in milk n' honey, swimming in milk n' honey
I'm swimming in milk n' honey, swi-swimming in milk n' honey
Dick in this bitch's stomach (Spending this bitch's money)
I'm swimming in milk n' honey, I'm swimming in milk n' honey
Swi-swimming in milk n' honey, swimming in milk n' honey
I'm swimming in milk n' honey, swi-swimming in milk n' honey
Dick in this bitch's stomach (Spending this bitch's money)

[Verse 3:]
I got gold, I got ice, I got Polo and Nikes
I got lean, I got Sprite, 'bout to spend a couple racks in one night
And mothafuckas wanna tell me take it light
Mothafuckas wanna tell me take it easy
I don't need no one's advice, niggas all wanna be me
I was riding down 6th and got stop by the pigs
They said "Hop out the whip, " I said "Fuck did I do?"
They said "Pop up the trunk, " I'm like pop up this dick
They said "Don't make us shoot, " they said "Don't make a move"
I was high as a kite, I had Xannies and white
I looked up at the light, like what the fuck is my life
They said my plates ain't legit, so they opened my shit
And when they opened my shit, it was snow in a fridge
I felt dumb as a brick, I had no idea
She had stolen the whip and this bitch had warrants and shit and
This bitch pulled multiple licks and this bitch had bodies on burners
And when I called her from my cell, the only message I heard was

[Outro:]
(It's yours, babe)
I mean you gotta do what you gotta do
Don't scr... don't say a fucking word
(It's yours, babe)
No, you don't say shit
Now I'm gone, I'm on a plane, babe
(It's yours, babe)
But no, you wanted to spend the money
You wanted to live, you know, wanted to live large
You got new sneakers and all that
So now you deal with them bricks
(It's yours, babe)
Na-na-na-nah, nah, I can't do nothing for you
I told you I'm on a G5, I'm gone
I'm too gone, I gotta go now
You say my fucking name - you a dead man
(I said okay)
