[Verse 1:]
Said
I'm naked down to my socks
Bitch I'm Anthony Kiedis
All this shaman I got
Put that right to your sneezers
Ride around on my block
VTA 2K Teasey
Fuck the police -
Okay back to my thesis
Hoes don't love 'em, don't treat 'em
I just teach 'em to stroke 'em
Pass that over to LODEF
He gon' pass it to hoder
He gon' lend it Nikos
Okay bases are loaded
Then she make it to Parker
She MVP with the trophy
Like get it right with the shotty
But it's made with a fender
Flavour flay with the top
I had no time to play pitches
You niggas acting like goalies
Yous a hatin' defender
I stay on Ps and Qs
Since the type of my sentence

[Hook:]
And I'm ready
If I don't go
Don't go
Don't go
I'm ready
Don't go
Don't go
Don't
Motherfucker I'm ready

[Verse 2:]
They oughta know
They oughta see
How you feeling, ohhh, that's that masterpiece
Did you roll or make it mine (Make your mind up)
We stay whole and you can wind (You can wind up)
Pick on the floorda, they gonna pop that cola
Bitch niggas wanna roll up, bitch nigga here get rolled up
Slow motion watch me win that corner (Win that corner)
Slow motion let she give me more, muh

[Verse 3:]
I can't stand what you got
Girl your ass is Movado
I can't help but to watch
Collard greens in my pocket
All these clouds I think I finally see the top

[Hook:]
And motherfucker I'm ready
If I don't go
I don't go
I don't go
I don't go
I'm ready
If I don't go
If I don't go
If I don't go
Motherfucker I'm ready
I don't go
I'm ready
If I don't go
If I don't go
I'm ready

[Outro:]
If you got a problem we can light it up
Light it up, we can light it up
If you got a problem we can light it up
Light it up, we can light it up
If you got a problem we can light it up
Light it up, we can light it up
If you got a problem we can light it up
Light it up, we can light it up
