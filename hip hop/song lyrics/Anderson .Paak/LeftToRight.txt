Like me some type of animal
They wan' call me cannibal (True)
Celebratin' like it's carnival (Yeah)
Left hand, signal
Bury the food in [?]
Ya haffi respect principle
You niggas do it to 'em minimal (Minimal)
I broke you down to a mineral
My gyal, we finally made it to the pinnacle
How long you niggas waited for the antidote?
My god, she got a stance like a antelope
(Oh, yes lawd)
An ass like a cantaloupe
Now strike a pose for the camera, yo
And go

Left to right, left-left to right
Left to right, left-left to right, whoa
Run it up, gyal, bring it low
Salute me like a five star general
Jump left to right, left-left to right
Left to right, left-left to right, oh
Bend over, gyal, touch your toe
Show me you got, bend ya bone
And go left to right, left-left to right

Girl, I'm back to act a fool wit' it
Said it all, I gotta fool wit' it
A nigga know just what to do with it
Real life, I know you miss me like you miss Obama
Real time, I been gettin' busy with them commas
Feels like I've been livin' life without a conscience
Realize that you're fuckin' with a real monster
[?]
You're too live, ya say ya do what ya don't
See me now, no need for hang up me coat
Big cloud, you see that ting with me smoke
[?] won't come, rip off them clothes
[?] clip off them nose
Cruiseliner, you know we control the boat
Who's finer? Fuck it, I'll take them both
They wanna break bread? Fuck it, I'll give 'em a loaf
Always encourage a nigga growth
Bad gyal, hold me down, never go
Buckwild, bustin' off a chemical
Sit it down, somethin' nice for ya hole
Ya pom pom digital [?]
Now come, come, digital
Let we make a movie, digital

Left to right, left-left to right
Left to right, left-left to right, whoa
I tried to tiptoe around it
Ya take me for fool
I lost my mind, but I found it
Now look at how I groove, ah
Pressed up beside me, hittin' me witcha thigh
Remindin' me what I do this for
So critical, so physical
So difficult, but still a miracle

I'm fuckin' up the weekend, I'm jumpin' off the deep end
I'm high as fuck in this bitch, think I'm finally peakin'
They wanna see me in a cell, they want me in the precinct
They wanna see me broke and sad, they want me street-sweepin'
They keep screamin' about, "Give me somethin' decent"
Now, why you disturbin' me now? BItch, I'm in a meetin'

Left to right, left-left to right
Left to right, left-left to right, whoa

Left hand, signal
Bury the food in [?]

Left to right, left-left to right, whoa

So critical, so physical
So difficult, but still a miracle
