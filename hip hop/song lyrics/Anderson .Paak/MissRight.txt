[Verse 1:]
I need the right one
With a bright imagination
Someone to talk to
Somebody patient
I want a cold piece
I want a love sensation
I want the mind first
I'll make the body wait for it (wait for it)
You could be the right one
With a little dedication
Gotta make me follow through
Gotta make me chase it
Ohh I want a stone groove
I wanna love sensation
Someone to hold to
Someone to play with

[Hook:]
Cause lately
My whole being
Just wants
What it needs
And I don't mind
(I need it
I just need, need, need)

[Verse 2:]
I want the right one
Car keys and a cake dish
Gotta take that (pipe work)
Gotta make me (taste it)
I mean amazing
You want my last name (say it)
Wanna have my baby (say it)
I'll take you all places
I want the world stage
Certified classic
Big planes
Light baggage (work)
I got the long reach (work, work)
You got that good conversation (work)
You such a cold piece
I wonder if you're taken

[Hook:]
Cause lately
My whole being
Just wants
What it needs
And I don't mind
(I need it
I just need, need, need)
Say it, say it (I just) I need (vamp)
