[Intro:]
All up in the air
All up in the air

[Verse 1:]
Kim plays with the heart strings
Late nights in the basement
Kills me with them soft notes
Offbeat placements
So sweet with the long notes
Blue dream with the light glow
I'll wait for the next show
But if you leave then I might roll
On your marks
When you're ready
Let me start
Okay, two shots and a slow dance
We walk to your home...
Keep up, keep up, keep up if you can

[Pre-Hook:]
Something different ain't it
Nothing like we planned
This ain't complicated

[Hook:]
All up in the air, all up in the air
We walk in the same directions with no common plans
Just the nature of a man, prob'ly cover good good good
All up in the air
All up in the air
And if it's love, then it's love
And if it's not love then it's all love
All up in the air, All up in the air
And if it's love, then it's real
And if it's not love then it's no deal
All up in the air, all up in the air
(Get em up)
All up in the air
All up in the air
All up in the air
All up in the air

[Verse 2:]
(Yeah), Slow dance in your compound when you're off that brown
Freelance in your hometown and it's good work now
Set it all down
(Set it all down)
Set it all, set it all, set it all back down
(Yeah) On your marks
When you're ready
Let me start, (okay)
Smooth talking and they stare
How often are you here?
Keep on, keep on, keep on if you care

[Hook:]
Something different ain't it?
This ain't like we planned
This ain't complicated
All up in the air, all up in the air
We walk in the same direction with no common plans
Guess it's just the nature of a man
Prob'ly cover good good good
All up in the air, all up in the air
And if it's love, then it's love
And if it's not love then it's all love
All up in the air, all up in the air
And if it's love then it's real
And if it's not love then it's no deal
All up in the air, all up in the air
(Get em up)
All up in the air, all up in the air
All up in the air, all up in the air
End
