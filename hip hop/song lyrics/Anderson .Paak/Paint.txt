[Pre-Hook:]
Ugh, that what you need? (ugh say)
Ugh, you need
Say, is that what you need?
Ugh, you need

[Hook 1:]
All I see is angels, demons
Soft lights a bitch sounds
From your first dream that be a sinner

[Verse 1:]
Running like your running for the gold one (gold one)
Back and forth of course it's never no one
They just want to frame you in the same shit (same shit)
Never been afraid to let it go (let it go)

[Hook 2:]
I just want to run it on the canvas
Brushes stroke is stroking but she go nuts
Speak of me as something you can ride on
Guess how many pages put you open up the gate and get it

[Hook 3:]
All day, no breaks
All day, no breaks
Mix it, clip it, switch it then
Change it, no breaks
All day, no breaks

[Post-Hook:]
Paint, paint, paint
Change it
Paint, paint
Ch' Change it

(Ehh Ohh Ehh)

[Hook 4:]
All I see is angels, demons
Soft lights a bitch sounds
From your first dream that be a sinner
Excuse for me not to to keep you creaming
Creaming, creaming, creaming, creaming

[Verse 2:]
Different, different colours that your changing (paint, paint)
A million ways a minute till it blows up (change it)
Fighting on your face, just face it (face it)
Take it till you say it
I am going to open up your place and paint it

[Hook 3:]
All day, no breaks
All day, no breaks
Mix it, clip it, switch it then
Change it, no breaks
All day, no breaks

[Pre-Hook:]
Ugh, that what you need (ugh say)
Ugh, you need
Say, is that what you need?
Ugh, you need

[Hook 1:]
All I see is angels, demons
Soft lights a bitch sounds
From your first your first dream be a sinner

[Verse 3:]
Looking like you woke up got a dreaming
Fishing where you living but there's no luck
Who can paint the picture like dale
Mixing different colours what I can do

[Hook 2:]
I just want to run it on your canvas
Stroking but she pushes stroking but she go nuts
Speak of me on something you can ride on
Guess how many stages put you open up the gates and get it

[Hook 3:]
All day, no breaks
All day, no breaks
Mix it, clip it, switch it then
Change it, no breaks
All day, no breaks

[Post-Hook:]
Paint, paint
Change it
Paint, paint
Change it
