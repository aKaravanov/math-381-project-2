[Verse 1:]
I don't miss her one bit
Maybe a little bit
Somedays I think about it
But I get over it real quick
It's too late to make amends
We could never be friends
I don't miss a warm bed
I miss that whip

[Hook:]
Damn, that whip
I miss that whip
That whip, that whip, that whip
I miss that whip

[Verse 2:]
She used to scoop me from the train station
Have a smoothie and a rented movie, pre-rolled J waitin'
(That whip, I miss that whip)
She didn't care about the reach
From the De Longpre to Long Beach
(That whip, that whip, that whip, that whip
I miss that whip)

[Hook:]
And damn, that whip
I miss that whip
That whip, that whip, that whip
I miss that whip
