[Verse 1:]
Why the hell would you run this game?
Both my hands are tied
Afraid of thinking I dug my own grave
Fuck around with this
Strange and elusive, too afraid to lose it
I don't mind this pain
Most nigga's want you for your candy
They'll never know just how long it takes
I wave my own pride
And put it all on the line

[Chorus:]
There I go, volunteering, punish me
Self inflicted pain, sickness over you
Way over you
Here I stay, time to time
It must be what you put me through
It must be what you put me through

[Verse 2:]
A little while longer
A bit more time
Why would you run these thoughts across my mind?
Please, relieve me
As cool as I remain
There's a point in which I'll lose my self restraint
Say, love, most niggas would've left you lonely
I fancy throwing it all away
I see it to my own demise
How much longer will I let it ride?

[Chorus:]
There I go, volunteering, punish me
Self inflicted pain, sickness over you
Way over you
Here I stay, time and time
It must be what you put me through
It must be what you put me through

[Outro:]
It must be what you put me through
It must be what you put me through
It must be what you put me through
