[Verse 1:]
I'm so tired of good health
I'm so tired of this roof and my bed
I'm so tired of cooked food and good moods
And good coup with AC to cruise
So tired of myself, my word and my wealth
Too big is my heart, too small are my cares
Then she said...
I'm so tired of making love
I'm so tired of being kissed
I'm so tired of making money
I'm so tired of this kush in my spliff, it don't make sense
I'm so tired of my family, my friends
I'm so tired of one night stands
So tired of living lavish, two birds in one nest
And being notorious

[Hook:]
Even when you're gone
I can still feel you
I want it more than ever
And don't you care?
But that's not fair
The only thing you ever really loved
Was right there, right there, right there
Even when you're gone
I can still feel you
I want it more than ever
And don't you care?
But that's not fair
The only thing you ever really loved
Was right there, right there, right there

[Verse 2:]
I'm so tired of this scene
I'm so tired of this ocean, this breeze
So tired but can't close my eyes to find sleep
So tired of this dream (reoccurring)
Your smile, your charm
Your patience, loyalty
Your love... ain't you tired of me?
To have it all, but not at all complete
Wanting you is all that ever drives my beat
That never-ending, ever-tempting, tipping-over
All my energy...
It's all that ever drives my being

[Hook:]
Even when you're gone
I can still feel you
I want it more than ever
And don't you care?
But that's not fair
The only thing you ever really loved
Was right there, right there, right there
Even when you're gone
I can still feel you
I want it more than ever
And don't you care?
But that's not fair
The only thing you ever really loved
Was right there, right there, right there
