

So fresh (so fresh)

And I know I was in love with you

First moment I met you,
Butterflies had me floating in the air,
That's how it felt
First word that I spoke
It made you smile
'Cause I got a little stuck

You laughed in my face, but I didn't care
'Cause it started the conversation
That led to our first date,
The old folks used to tell me,
I'd know it when I felt it
I know it's true if they're just like you

So fresh [4x]
First time that I closed my eyes
Leaned in and your lips touched mine

So fresh [4x]
Like my favorite record
I swear you could play forever
