Moon river wider than a mile
I'm crossing you in style someday
A dream maker
My heartbreaker
Wherever you're going I'm going that way

Two drifters off to see the world
There's such a crazy world to see
We're all chasing after all the same
Chasing after our rainbow's end

Moon river wider than a mile

My dream maker
Heartbreaker
Wherever you're going I'm going the same

Two drifters off to see the world
It's such a crazy world you'll see
We're all chasing after our end
Chasing after our ends

Life just around the bend my friend
Moon river and me
