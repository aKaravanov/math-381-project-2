Whenever the sun don't shine on the west side
You know I'm sitting pretty right by your side
Baby I'm down for you, I'm down for you
Said baby I'm down for you, I'm down for you
Whenever the sun don't shine on the west side
You know I'm sitting pretty right by your side
Said baby I'm down for you, down for you
I'm down for you, down for you, down for you

[GoldLink:]
Pulled up to the rita spot where you calls me daddy
Told my girl "man, I hit your phone say where you happy at?"
We ain't speak in four or five months, so I'm nervous now
You said that you heard my last shit, so I know you're mad
Oh man, still that nigga?
Uptown with the hittas
Pop a nigga like we pop a wheely
Niggas gon' crazy in the city
If we do show up in the city
Just did that instead of rockin' with me
Always keep it so one thousand with ya
Always down to run a mountain for ya

[Jessy Rose:]
Whenever the sun don't shine on the west side
You know I'm sitting pretty right by your side
Baby I'm down for you, I'm down for you
Said baby I'm down for you, I'm down for you
Whenever the sun don't shine on the west side
You know I'm sitting pretty right by your side
Said baby I'm down for you, down for you
I'm down for you, down for you, down for you

[Goldlink:]
Roll up, rockin', get to poppin' with ya
Ain't nobody get to fightin' with ya
Ain't nobody get the pipe and hit ya
And none a nigga, can't nobody get ya
Wild nigga from the wild side
DC nigga so I'm real dry
Yeah yeah got the mock top from the heat side to the west side
Super fake with the hoes now
Counting money with the bros now
G starrin' from a Benz
Lick, lick, lick, lick with the scope now
Skrt, skrt in the coup (huh)
Ask a shawty what it do? (huh)
I ain't really mean to fall in love with a hood bitch but it's you

[Jessy Rose:]
I will be right by your shoulder, babe
And when the weather gets colder
Know that I'm right there
Said you should know that I'm right there
I will be right by your shoulder, babe
And when the weather gets colder
Know that I'm right there
Said you should know that I'm right there

Whenever the sun don't shine on the west side
You know I'm sitting pretty right by your side
Baby I'm down for you, I'm down for you
Said baby I'm down for you, I'm down for you
Whenever the sun don't shine on the west side
You know I'm sitting pretty right by your side
Said baby I'm down for you, down for you
I'm down for you, down for you, down for you
