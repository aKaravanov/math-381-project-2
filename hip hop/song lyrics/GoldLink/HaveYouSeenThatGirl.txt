Real nigga with the leg on the dock
Feelin' straight
All the drug dealing niggas with their gashes out
Bad hood ass bitches with they asses out

Talkin' bout goddamn
Have you seen that girl?
Have you seen that girl?

I was out Fairmont Heights with the hitters
Then a little bad jawn walk by
Louis purse to the side, goddamn
Shorty, where you from?
Where your momma stay?
She's at five and one, capping where her Momma stay
Her ex man still get it wild, right all night babe
Shit baby, I don't care bout that anyway

Goddamn
Have you seen that girl?
Have you seen that girl?

I was out walk, wallin' with the project boys
Lookin' at this little fine ass joint with her french braid
Black shades, little attitude, ass wide like a lamp shade
Down the neck is with the gold grill front
Roger bitch, with the Louboutin pumps
Georgetown, where I take her out to lunch

Talkin' bout
Have you seen that girl?
Have you seen that girl?

I was out Simple City with the bike niggas
Talkin' bout mad men then a girl walked by
Dark skinned woman with a curve on her sides
I need whole fitty, you my fries on the side
You can be my little dunk thing for the night
But ain't bout to get you baby, we ain't bout to ride

Talkin' 'bout where ya ex been?
Have I seen that girl?
Have I seen that girl?

I was out Landover, me and all, then all and them
Lil model tryna know way way back when
She ain't never give me play
So I played her friend
Then she wanna try to holla
Then I played to win
Then the homegirl brother tried to fight me
I had to have the nigga kiss the bottom of my Nikes
Talkin' bout he from Trinidad so he rep the 12
I don't give a fuck about ya, see yo ass in hell

Talkin' bout goddamn
Have you seen that girl?
Have you seen that girl?

I was out Clay Terrace, feeling better than all the guys
Bad white joined
Fat ass hips and thighs
Talkin' bout kill mo, all you do is lie
I ain't lyin' when I tell you that you fine as wine
Lemme get a 'lil sip, lemme get a 'lil bit
Lemme grab on your ass, I mean grab you the gas

Talkin' bout goddamn
Have you seen that girl?
Have you seen that girl?

Have you seen that girl?
Have you seen that girl?
