Pretty woman, pretty girl with pretty thighs
Sorta black woman, had me feeling like I'm 35
Get a girl, hit her with the phrase
Like in my waist
Hit her both ways
As her main nigga and a sidekick

I met her in the summer, started with a kiss
And she fucked so good
That I had to flood her wrist
Two days in and I wanna have her kid
Then she told me she belong to a city and her boy
Wear a wig and a cig just to smoke away her tears
And I wanna learn about her fears
And touch her rear
I think I love her
Can't nobody come before her
Ain't no one above her
And I wrote this like a sucka singing

Looking for the one that's right for me
Where do I go? (Oh-oh-oh)
Where do I find her? (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

Pretty woman, pretty girl and pretty thighs
Sorta black woman, had me feeling like I'm 35
Get it girl, hit her with the phrase
Still stuck in my ways
Hit her both ways
As her main nigga and a sidekick
Lil' rider, fuck me like a side chick
She down like a Northface with some visors
Bank credit card scamming for deposits
And when I do, do my thing she never stop me
She love to love me, loving me is like a hobby
Loving the dough, and my nigga Joe
I told him hit the phone
She never let a nigga get too close
If I die, she'll probably marry me
And love my ghost
So I had to work and get the Ghost
Had to work harder so the bitch'll see the Ghost
Oh, my baby riding in it
And my baby riding tinted
And I only fuck with you because I got you
When I get it

I don't know why I care about you
Care about you
I don't know why I care about you

I don't wanna motherfucking care about you

I'm a die but you remember the guy
From selling grams
The size of Gamecube memory card
Yeah yeah, I got a problem with your ex
And he know
That if he hit your phone again
I gotta shoot with the 4
'Fore I hit a nigga crazy
Leaving brains on the floor
That's the, "yeah keep it moving"
Like I'm hitting a ho
Anyway just know I love you more and more
And it shows
And I promise baby girl
I'll probably never let go

Because I need you more
