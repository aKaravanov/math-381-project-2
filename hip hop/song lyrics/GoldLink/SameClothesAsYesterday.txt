[Ciscero:]
I show these niggas what I'm worth everyday
I thank Jesus cause he keep me blessed man
Niggas get murked everyday
My people that's gone
Cause they made me strong
Even though that they hurt everyday
Told my momma I'm a be somebody
But she told me to go to church everyday
I'm making things work everyday
I'm getting closer to food that's booster flow
I'm waking everybody up that's rooster flow
And you ain't now you just [?]
You ain't fly, you just Rufio
I'm in the backseat of a black jeep
Feeling classy
Niggas wanna trap me (ay)
Acting like they getting at me (ay)
But that do is at me (ay)
Fly as I'm supposed to be
Y'all just some hoes to be, lines in my holster
I ain't got time to be rhyming for groceries (ay)
Time's been so good to me
I've been in ovaries
Got so many girls like I've been in Jodeci (ay)
And there's so many relationships
I still ain't as wise as supposed to be
Devil be trying these rappers and [?]
Man it's crazy how niggas need devil worship to keep up
Cheap stuff, I'm so 301 mo, my jeans cuffed
Looking like I'm a Brooklyn prince
I don't know what I'm on the brink of
Doing rap tours like I'm Rookie Vince
My mom had a stroke ten years ago
She really been cooking since I tell her

[GoldLink:]
All my niggas stay
Wildin' in this bitch
All this bullshit happened
I still smile through the shit
I ain't really really even supposed to here
They don't want me here
But I ain't bout to leave here (what what what)
All my niggas stay
Wildin' in this bitch
All this bullshit happened
I still smile through the shit
I ain't really really even supposed to here
They don't want me here
But I ain't bout to leave here (what what what)

I don't give a fuck about shit my nigga
I don't give a fuck about shit
I don't give a fuck about shit my nigga

I'm ridin' 'round and my car's low
Nigga what you waiting for
Big dick in her tonsils
Yeah I got a big ego hoe
Ridin' 'round and my bitch high
And grip her thighs
I might fuck that right
Wildin' out, I might make her mine
Might blow her high
Go kill a nigga, be a real nigga
Still rock put it for a kill figure
Never trust a hoe cause she's gon' fuck whoever feels bigger
See seat to my seat nigga
Big sunnies he beat niggas
I don't give no fuck
I might just come around start heatin' niggas
You fake ass rap niggas
Like Big Reese might slap niggas
All you niggas my children now
But I ain't even 'bout to tax niggas
Fuck her ride her passion (ay)
All talk gain no action (ay)
No no feel no type of way
Momma said you better pray
For these little D.C. boys, you might get hit with a stray
Congress parked at MLK, they'll just give us any day
Man a lot been on my mind, like how y'all feel when I die
Everybody gon' cry, go head just build my shrine

All my niggas stay
Wildin' in this bitch
All this bullshit happened
I still smile through this shit
I ain't really really even supposed to here
They don't want me here
But I ain't bout to leave here (what what what)
All my niggas stay
Wildin' in this bitch
All this bullshit happened
I still smile through this shit
I ain't really really even supposed to here
They don't want me here
But I don't bout to leave here (what what what)

I don't give a fuck about shit my nigga
I don't give a fuck about shit
I don't give a fuck about shit my nigga
