All of my bitches got friends, yeah
All of my bitches got friends
And they bad, they bad, so we good
It's enough for the clique, word
All of my bitches got friends
You don't need to pick, nah
All of my bitches got friends

Look, I ain't really gotta rap about it
I just talk about it 'cause I live it now
So let me tell you 'bout this PYT
That I seen this week, I had to take a bow
5'2" with a brown fur
And her hair tied with them light eyes
And she would make me throw it all away
For a fun time and the right prize
Mad as fuck, ass fatter than an hammer truck
Ask her, prolly keep my hammer tucked
The type to slide 'em down and then the panties stuck
I'll run 'em up, wanna kick it with you
Get a house and a picket with you
Pop up on you at your work place, not your birthday
Just to let them niggas know I'm buildin' with you
Your best friend, always comin' through
With that Macaulay Culkin when you're home alone
And I ain't even tryna dog you out
But can you feed a nigga just a little bone?
One of you, one of me, you and me
We make three or maybe four, and just two more just to even score
Step to her, had to play chess
Had to hit her with the full press
Then I told her I'd do anything just to chat with her for a quick sec'
Let it sit, let it process, then she went and said, "So, yes"
Whispered in her ear and told her, "Baby I want less drama and more sex," but

Look, all of my women got friends
Most of 'em like with a blend
And most of 'em off in the ends
And they don't care who they offend
Look, I had a girl who was tatted up
From the neck down, she was super crazy
Met a shorty with an ill grammar
Who would fight a lot and she a '90s baby
Complain about me, always on the road
And talk to other women and she wanted babies
Had to shake it like a common cold
Then I had a show and then I saw you, baby
Then I book you
Now we textin' back-to-back-to-back-to-back with no indication
Now I'm flyin' to you
Takin' you across the world to see a couple different faces
Hood nigga dreams, fuck like movie scenes
Hit it from the back, boost your self-esteem
Heard you left to visit cuz and them
Reconnectin' with your mom and them
Now you want me to fly to Sweden
After, fly you to the Motherland
You was mine and I am yours
And you still mine when I go on tour
I ain't really tryna play no games
I can win the battle, you can win the war
I'm just tryna fuck and love you either
On the bed and we can take it to the floor
Crazy how this all started out 'cause I saw somethin' that I can't ignore
