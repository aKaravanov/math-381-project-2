Yo Cocaine its not rice
Bitch I am back
Coming back bitch
I am coming back
And I am posted up on your Cadillac
And my hoes are tight
And your bitch ain't bad
Cardiac its all beating fast
[?] I should beat your ass
Pop nigga where your pops at nigga
Real nigga rock gold til its touchdown nigga
Juice and Juice
Got a nigga loose
Hang a nigga noose
Bottle goose
Popping off the top
The top we popping too
Flow is terrible
Heroin addict
I am so advit
I am much better than your dealer
Cause my music makes a habit havoc
We just having fun
We killing niggas for the fuck of it
Running shit
Last year we were quiet
Now we want it bitch
Feeling like Big L
Back up in his Harlem Days
He says he's so unfadable
I fade him like I am Hardaway
He contemplate
I am contemplate if I should let him live today
I am so gorgeous
[?]
He says these hoes ain't shit to me
My top laid back
And my rims shine too
And my head be looking spiffy
And my shoes be fly too
Baldwin
Fallin
Never fall completely off
When I be sporting
Count your blessings
Never stressing
Bitch I am flexing when I do
I do say great no lie
Can a young nigga spit so nice
Can a clip hit a nigga with a five
Can a five hit a nigga like a nine
We deep as a motherfucker
Rolling like a clan
Greatest motherfucker with the mic up in my hand
Never looking backwards
We only seek for better things
Your favorite road girl just hit me up
She need that mary jane
She golden
Posted
Rolled it
And smoked it
I told her to take this dick
Like wait
And hold it
Like mirror motherfucking mirror
Mirror on the wall
Who got bigger juicy golden balls than your dog
See I am a crazy motherfucker
With an ugly nigga face
Pretty nigga voice
I take the strap [?]
Peek a boo the pussy
Bitch I need me something new
Treat me like a baby
Let's play blue clues with the crew
Nine nina
Rolling up that stinker
Smoking on that steamer
Rolled that beam up
Bigger body benz
Fucking all your friends
It ain't my fault she said she want that dick
I piped that shit
Plus it hurt
She said she need that work

[Breakdown]
