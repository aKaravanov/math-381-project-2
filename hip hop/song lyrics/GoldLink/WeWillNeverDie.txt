We will never die, real niggas they multiply
I watch my mother cry, my ma watches his mother get high
You know that I'm a do it, I don't even gotta try
I'm smokin' 93, that shit put me in the sky
Man, hold that shit down
You don't gotta fuckin' lie
These bitches stay around, they just tryin' to get high
Them choppers, they coming supersizin', took a couple lives
I got a tear drop on my face but I will never cry
And she can't come around if she not down for the ride
Sippin' too much lean my stomach up another size
Ain't into all the hype 'cause niggas steal too many lives
And I know he don't want beef 'cause he wanna stay alive
Y'all know

Goddamn, young lean straight the slums runnin' shit here
You don't know what I been through for us to start gunnin' round here
Main bitch always stressin', talkin' 'bout why you're never 'round here
If a nigga owe me money put it in a bullet, aim it right there
Goddamn go, go, no show nigga don't fuck around about here
'Cause niggas get here same niggas know I plead to the kids
Kids now can't fight no more, they just gun you down out of feat
And I ain't never had fear
And I don't shoot or gift fair
And I'm as bad as these kids now 'cause I kill anything near
And trigger never had heart, the heart's been in the kids
Get Crisco when they might young, niggas set you up here
And yeah I don't know the end near
And fuck the charters last year
Dancin' why the niggas get the reckless
Forty on me had to tuck the necklace
Grab my waist and had to double check them just in case he checkin' what I think he checkin'
Wasn't made I was born tough
Clickbait on me like a handcuff
Nine nine two's now my jeans cuffed, niggas thought he finna fuck the scene up
And I told him
