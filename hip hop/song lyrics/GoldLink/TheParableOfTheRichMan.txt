Girl I don't want nobody, and you don't want nobody
I was just getting started, let this be your party
I don't want nobody, and you don't want nobody
I was just getting started, let this be your party

You called me on my phone last night
And you told me send the homies home that night
And you said nobody was invited
And you really didn't make yourself excited
Then you said your "Lucy, Lucy" with a kissy face
Then I said, "Well I don't know no fucking Lucy, babe"
Then you said, "Well yeah you know me from your latter days
Who ya think was running with ya when your homies cave?
And when they ran up in your shit that made your homies lay?
Or when them Baltimore niggas shine at your face?
Or when them motherfucking niggas from the SouthSide?
Lit your block up, but ya wasn't even outside?
Or remember when a nigga tried to jump you?
And you called a handgun strap and the ran, fool?
Or remember when your broke black ass was hungry?
In the fridge and now ya only eat the finer things
Now let me tell ya

I don't want nobody, you don't want nobody
Let's just get it started, let this be our party
I don't want nobody, you don't want nobody
Let's just get it started, let this be our party

I said, "aight baby, listen, what you want then?"
She said, "nothing I just want you leave your girlfriend"
I said, "hell nah, shawty what you talkin' 'bout?"
She said, "nigga you know what the fuck I'm talking 'bout!"
Or should I bring up
When you was fucking on so-and-so on tour
When you were lying, telling her that
She the only one who getting dick
Saying that you love that other bitch and how you need a fix
And ain't nobody hitting on that shit like you be doing it
Wait, hol' up, hol' up
Aright look I ain't tryna tell take it there

In this world mother, no one can love me
In this world they do not know how to love me
In this world mother, no one can love me
In this world they do not know how to love me
Where is that pure loving love
Where is that truly loving me
Where is that pure loving love
Where is that truly loving me
Their white song longs to me
Their white song longs to me
In this world mother, no one can love me
In this world they do not know how to love me
In this world mother, no one can love me
In this world they do not know how to love me
Where is that pure loving love
Where is that truly loving me
Where is that pure loving love
Where is that truly loving me
Their white song longs to me
Their white song longs to me
