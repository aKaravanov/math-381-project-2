Just worry about yourself
You better grab your pockets 'cause I'm coming for that wealth
And I be aiming for the chop, and I'm not talking about no shelf
And I be blowing on some shit they say that's bad for your health
And I can do it by myself, I don't need nobody
But I need my team to blow and that's word to young Roddy
And my words so crack, calling me a young Bobby
And everybody gone know me 'cause everybody gone watch me like Houston we got a problem
They know I'm from Richmond so they think I'm gone rob 'em
But they right, get 'em from my rights, I got problems
They know what I hold, but they think I'ma fold
I need money for shows, you use money on clothes
I pay attention to business, you pay attention to hoes
I said your mind on the wrong things
Tell 'em fuck the unncessary and small things
Niggas killing for territory and drug claims, it ain't the same thing
It ain't the same game, but I play my position so I can maintain
These niggas stuck in the traffic up in the same lane
I think smarter, but nigga we got the same brain
I use it different, I stress my people to listen
I'm telling you cause I lived it
Don't hesitate, go and get it
I'm talking to myself and all my niggas that's with it
So we can be better than niggas that did it
Intelligent and I'm gifted, you better watch your back
If you close to edge, you better watch that crack
My niggas close to that bread so they keep that MAC
It's a lot of bad apples, better watch that batch
It's like a movie, truly up in the making
You can see it for yourself like you was watching the Matrix
Don't take a pause, I'm telling niggas be patient

Now let's start the show
Now let's start the show
Now let's start the show
Now let's start the—
