Alright, J.I.D and Christo
Y'all niggas need to lay off the drugs
Some of y'all need to lay off the dope
My niggas getting it straight off the boat
Pure cut, put it straight to your nose
I ain't nosy, but I know what I know
Mr. Know It All, oh here he go
I'm the GOAT, I never go with the flow
Throwing shots boy, blow for a blow
I'm the nigga kick the do' with the dough
I'm the nigga fuck the hoe with the hoe
I'm the nigga lit the blunt with the blunt
I'ma get it 'cause I want what I want
I'ma say this shit again and again
I'ma go and put the shit to an end
I'm the sickest with the pencil and pen
Hit the blunt and mix the Hen' with the wait
I'ma go ahead and lay off the xans
I'ma fall back sipping the lean
I gotta make sure my vision is clear
Oh God, no, it's not what it seems
Six, five, four, one, two, three
.45 toe, you know me
You don't what smoke, so what it's gon' be?
Gotta watch what you say when you looking at me
Looking at God, looking for leaders
Looking for keys, look at the pain in your eyes
Nigga, look where we been
Look at our wins, look at our sins, and look at our skin
I've been on a frenzy binge trying to get me a Benz
Your fuzzy ass dance won't fuck up the ends
Oh God, no, where are my friends?
Lord forgive me yeah, I need to repent
My blood need to lay off the drugs
Yeah God, they ain't praying enough
Niggas dying, we ain't saying enough
Cops fire, stockpiling rottweilers
Tell my little niggas lay off the stuff
Ronald Reagan, I can't thank him enough
Nah, I'm playing, nigga racist as fuck
Told my nigga if leave a pack of ports around me, I'ma take em'
And throw em' away
Smoke em' around me, I'ma break em'
And we almost had got into fighting and I'm talking
My dead dad finna fade him, shit
Maybe I did too much, but fuck it
I love my nigga, I'ma say it
And he probably thinkin' I'm a player hater
I don't hate a player, I just need all my niggas to wake up
And take a real good look, we along way from Decatur
Long day still ahead of us
Grown dads still scared of us
I'm just working my incredibles
Stick my dick into the inevitable
So fuck whatever happen, fucking cinematic
Sins of the father, I'ma fucking addict
Understand the diction, so I'm sympathetic
But I know, I know, I know that I gotta be strong
I ain't trying to be where I don't belong
Little syrup sipping out of a foam
Little powder put the pot in the bong
I ain't tripping, I ain't saying it's wrong
But, it's some other shit, we can be on...
