Everybody wanna be something
Be something, don't be nothing
Everybody gotta be something
Everybody gotta love somebody
Everybody gotta fuck somebody
Love somebody, don't fuck anybody
Everybody gotta be something

Look, it's like quiet as kept, I been the sickest for a sec
I never been pressed for all the cameras and the press
I'm not the type of guy that be wildin' for respect
I'd rather be wildin' for a check
I'm doing that now to manifest, I got my head right and it's blessed
Yeah, the rap game like checkers and chess
And tryna make a monopoly, I got a lot of mess
But it's cool, I'ma test it
Got my choice route, I'm destined for greatness
Patience is cool, I had to learn that too
I had got kicked out of school like, "Nigga, fuck y'all rules"
And them niggas that snitched on me, yeah it's fuck y'all too
My momma hit a nigga phone like what the fuck y'all do? Nothing
I just finesse, I'll give 'em back all they little money
But everybody gotta juug somebody, huh
Everybody gotta juug somebody, yeah

Everybody gotta be something
Everybody wanna be something
Be something, don't be nothing
Everybody gotta be something
Everybody gotta love somebody
Everybody gotta fuck somebody
Love somebody, don't fuck anybody
Everybody gotta be something

They asked me what's my sound? I tell 'em nothing particular
I'm blowing this purple 'til I feel perpendicular
My flow crash like homicide vehicular
Leave a nigga's brain at the scene, sign for signature
Kicking rhymes as I'm flipping through the pages of literature
Literally, I'm the shit, what you having for dinner?
Born to win but born a sinner, and that's word to Jermaine
Cold flow, Cole World, but we living the same
I was standing in the hall, we was listening to Dame
He was schooling some niggas, putting them up on some game
I'm ear hustling, hoping my niggas doing the same
Shit, that he saying, my brain strain, combust into flames
He dropped gems 'bout life and getting up in the game
Or getting fucked in the game and how it's really kinda tough to complain
When you can be what you want, it not really much to explain
So fuck that, hustle for cream and go for the dream

Everybody gotta be something
Everybody wanna be something
Be something, don't be nothing
Everybody gotta be something
Everybody gotta love somebody
Everybody gotta fuck somebody
Love somebody, don't fuck anybody
Everybody gotta be something
