Look at the passion I possess
The pain manufactured a champion
Stamp the game
My name lasts forever
The rain is coming
The thunder's crashing
Fire-breathing dungeon dragon
Take a chance
Inspire the kids that never had it
Own the chaos and you own the magic
Then say, "Why not?" to anybody who asking

I know you got a question, you looking for answers
I only have one answer...
Own the chaos and you own the magic
To all the questions you ask me...
Then say, "Why not?" to anybody who asking
Why not?
