And this shit's already twisted 'cause I fucked some of her sisters, I opened it up, dicked in, and I stretched it like a gymnast
She said she wanted to end it 'cause she wants us to have friendship, she said that via text and that's hell of a way to end shit
And then I felt silly 'cause I let Siri read it to me
It's a bad feeling inside my tummy put some loud to it
Express my pain through my music, let the crowd do it
They all like my style because I'm wild foolish
I hit a bitch with a smile and tell her I'll do the honours of being your bone jumper
Ugga ugga, a caveman descended of slave damn, who used to grow that weed in the cotton fields nigga amen
Brought my grandparents greats used to wake and bake, so for them, I'ma take a [?] to the face
You scrape, You scrape

Yo, what's good?
Oh so now you wanna answer the phone? Where the fuck have you been in?
I've been waiting on yo' ass, where have you been?
Don't even answer that 'cause I don't want a goddamn answer I'm over this shit now
I was waiting on yo' ass last night, in the house, in the bed [?]
Fuck that, and fuck you, and fuck everything you're about, you ain't ever gonna be shit, you ain't shit 'till the day you die nigga your momma ain't shit, your daddy ain't shit, your uncle ain't shit your auntie ain't shit, your whole family ain't shit
[?]

Uh
Typical night, invisible white, my visions entice my delights [?] the fucking lights
And salt's getting thrown like rice after the invite
So the join of two beams you ain't feeling what I'm seeing so I'm leaving
And I won't leave with no fucking demons, so I'ma place all my sins on the damn table, in front of God and whoever able to see the fables I created
Lies, imagination, and hatred
Death to making love, without really actually love making, faking it just to get you naked, flexin' and flakin'
I'm a filthy nigga face it, but not just too complex to fuck with someone basic, that's a overstatement
