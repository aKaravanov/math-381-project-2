Yeah, I love her hair, I love her flavor
She just waiting on a nigga to save her
She was waiting on a nigga to chase her
And when my niggas not around, I probably will face her
She look so small and mouth so loud
She stuck sometimes, but that's her style
And whenever I'm in another nigga town I browse and look til that pretty bitch found
Cali girl, she came from the Westside (the Westside, the Westside)
And I'm from the Eastside like Reggie Brown
And all I smoke is the medical

Fish got wings, snakes on feet

Everybody say
