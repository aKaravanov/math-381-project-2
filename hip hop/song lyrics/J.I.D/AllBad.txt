[J.I.D & Marian Mereba:]
And if I'm trying to tell the truth, it's all bad
'Cause if you looking for the proof, it's all there
Come on baby, I'ma tell the truth and nothing but the truth
You can't handle the truth, you can't handle it, ah
And if I'm trying to tell the truth, it's all bad
'Cause if you looking for the proof, it's all there
Come on baby, I'ma tell the truth and nothing but the truth
You can't handle it, you can't handle the truth, no

[J.I.D:]
And if I'm trying to tell the truth, it's all bad
Baby, do you love me? I know that you do
I been trying so hard, I know I gotta be real with you
Can't be playing with hearts, I know you feel like you feel it too
I'm gon' step into the shade
I don't want the sun in my face, but I don't want to walk away
Without me saying what I have to say
And I been praying it's another way
But it's like mayhem on my fucking brain
I gotta say, I'm finna go insane, shame, shame
And I don't know what I can do (fuck)
'Cause maybe you're past I
And maybe your last guy was probably just right for you
And baby, I can't fight the truth
Baby, I can't fight the truth
And baby, I can't fight with you, yeah

[J.I.D & Marian Mereba:]
And since I'm trying to tell the truth, it's all bad
And since you're looking for the proof, it's all there
Come on baby, I'ma tell the truth and nothing but the truth
You can't handle the truth, you can't handle it
And since I'm trying to tell the truth, it's all bad
And since you're looking for the proof, it's all there
Come on baby, I'ma tell the truth and nothing but the truth
You can't handle the truth, you can't handle the truth, no

And since I'm trying to tell the truth
So tell me why you got to lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie?
So tell me why you got to lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie?

[Marian Mereba:]
See I'ma call it off here, oy this intuition ancient, oh
You ain't even really gotta say shit
I peep your in-the-cut shit, yeah, I'm a sharp motherfucker
Girl, no peace 'til we sleeping
We find reasons for deceiving
And then we both can keep the secret
I remember when it felt like a dream
I hope it's a blessed world
Though I bet your next girl won't tell you the truth, like I do
It's just we were closing on a new height
You never let sleep that hand on my hip
It was Heaven, it was bliss 'til it flipped right
I ain't finna lie to you though
I ain't finna cry, never mind that you lied
That you spilled milk all on my clothes (fuck)
They say you reap what you sow
Lord knows that's some lies I've been told
Oooh watch it grow

[J.I.D & Marian Mereba:]
And I done finally heard the truth is all bad
I wasn't looking for the proof, but God damn
Come on baby, you should tell the truth, but baby fuck the truth
I can't handle it, you can't handle it

[Mereba:]
You got me extremely fucked up
