Tryna get a trophy over my head I can hoist it
Be inside trapped by this pink pussy poison

No pressure bitch because I'm barely five sev'

Pussy boy dunce

You talkin special teams go and cover some punts
You niggas cunts

But I'm reincarnated
Double play cause the pavement with Cartiers
Star blazing take the bump off the cross of your necklace
Take a shot too
Moonshinin it's all cool
Go and pick your girl up

Swaggin in her ear that bitch cummin on the bar stool
Given that bitch lower then the bar this is law school
Please remove your bra and your shwawl too

Couple associates, friends
