[J.I.D.:]
Y'all niggas lookin' like money, ching-ching
Light shine, starin' at your wrist, bling-bling
Lightweight J.I.D., get drunk off a Yuengling
Let that thing sing, sing, sing, send him to Sing Sing
But I ain't got time for no jail time, no
Pick them shells up, let 'em cool down, blow
Pull up to your big ass crib like ("Hello?")
Nobody here? Y'all ready to go?
I got division like Mansa Musa
Can fuck your bitch like a barracuda
Uzi tooly Boolie, who the shooter?
Yeah, it's not mine, cause I forgot the ruger
Never been a gangster, I'm riding with my seatbelt on
Tryna drive and roll up all of this weed in my palms

Twenty-five to life, it all started with a coca leaf
I swear I been the dopest this not how its supposed to be
Niggas spent the bend and shot at everybody close to me
And they killed my nigga T, dome shot, R.I.P
Niggas killing niggas I ain't even get the notion
They out here catching bodies and a nigga ain't provoke em
Oh shit, guess I need to pick me up a strap now
Nowadays, niggas don't even know how to act (Bow)
Run to the hills to avoid the high waters
They flooded the crops, kill pops, they tryn' done us
They Marshawn Lynch with the Glock, they ran rumpus
Dunk us, Jordan signs seen clear when they stomp us
Sick of Atlanta, I hit my girl, then flew to Dulles
Bumping Dwele, dwelling on the past they ain't tell us about
All we do is accept they bullshit they sell us

[Key!:]
Okay!
Niggas ain't talking how they living
(For real!... Okay!...)
