You elegant asshole
Elegant asshole
Asshole, asshole, asshole

Uh, bad taste in my mouth from a lad tate
But how this taste
Eat the plate, eat the cake
How it make out for your satisfied face, make you wanna slap your mom and break a vace
Shit, I mean't a voss
Valentine's day, sent a condom in the cart to your broad
I took a leap of faith, I'm J.I.D frogger
She knew I was the shit when the tolied bowl clogged
I could spot an ant on a tree in the fog
So easily I could see the bullshit in niggas talking
Twitter celebrities and pussy ass bloggers
If you knew the folks you said you knew, you probably wouldn't be talking
I told ya'll this shit was getting awkward, now this shit awful
I used to have one bitch, now I got a coffin
Used to have to cough, now I sip lean, so I'm snoring
Feeling like a brand new man in the morning
Yawning, howning, hungry
Shawty making eggs, waffles, and cornbeef hash
And I'm bout to go smash it after I smoke
After I smoke, then I'ma smash her
And she wants more after, but I gotta abracadabra
Gotta go, gotta dip, gotta go, got shit to do
And I know that probably don't mean shit to you
But no pressure, I could have her on the leash if I let her have her way
But I know it's something out there better
And mama told me never settle for the lessers (never ever)
Never, unless you
Your such a afradite
Your such a goddess
I probably knew a UFO in the orbit
But I ain't finna fuck around with the shwty
What you mean, bro?
I'm finna cool cous', I'm finna cool it
That's all I got, that's all I got
Elegant asshole
Asshole, asshole

Elegant asshole
You elegant asshole
Elegant asshole
Asshole, asshole, asshole
