Just the way you said it, just the same way
This shit kinda special right now
I don't know what you're talking about
No... c'mon you know what I'm talking about
If I'm not mistaken, you just tried to bribe a federal officer
No technically I didn't bribe anybody
No, no that's not the conversation I heard

I got weed on my head, but don't call me a weed head
Fleas in my bed, but don't say I'm a dog
Them niggas thought we were cool because they saw me with y'all
I'm sorry that you're confused, but they aren't arguing dog
They tried to shit on "jed", I just use it as fertilizer
I came from a twig, from seeds to burglarizer
Am high as a bitch, I got women to circumcise you
Circulatory service, service to sanitize you

I got cheese on my head, but don't call me a cheese head
I'm packing like a packer,when it comes to cheese bread
I said I need money, I got to keep that bread close
Bread dough, hopefully I can eat a day's loaf
My bitches love me, I know so, because they say so
Broke nigga they got no job and shit paid for
Except for the ride that nigga "jig" got the age flow
Secrets of bitch, but then again they get paid for
There need to be an exact dollar figure for the exchange services that would not hold up to court of law
No no

I want to tell you this
Sail on boat fit for a bond villain
Sometimes you need to play the part right?
