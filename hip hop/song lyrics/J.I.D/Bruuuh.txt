D-D-D...Damn
Said I'm back again to whoop ass
The blicka-blast from the ratchet, man
The maddest black as lad in a savage land of grab and dash and crash in your daddy's van
D-D-D, D-D-D
Bad as the most have-inist, most swaggiest, braggy as never had anything
So I'm acting as if I never had shit
I was moving backwards, I coulda hit a backflip, check this
I ain't never hustled for a necklace
Tryna get the fam straight, get us out of debt shit
That shit get testy
I feel Dizzie Gillespie in a room packed, me call, is he? I'm precious
Out the womb, I was last, I'm the youngest of 7
Birthday same day as the reverend
Birthday same day as the devil
Black lock like the pot and a kettle
Wreck shop, a monotonous fellow
Lick a shot for my niggas tryna stop the journey
JID pull up on a opp like what's poppin' kermie
Blocka Blocka, operate, doctor, surgery, IVs, gurneys, shit bag, gone for eternity, hey
More the merrier, more to come murder me, hey
Close the casket, common the courtesy, hey
Head shots, too personal for a burglary, ooh
Red dots cause killers could close curtains me
I done did wrong, someone send me up vertically
Horizontally, read me a passage from Deuteronomy
Anything you can do to conquer the demon inside of me
Inner meaning the truth and the father, the spirit guided me
I can bleed in the booth and leave a tooth as a souvenir for who was here and if you hearing it
You know the spirit is imperitive, imperative, imperial
Black man pyramid, the peer of men, jack man with the gat
Scratching off the serial
Sack man, get the pack
Money in the envelope
Pissing down the urinal
Ass man in the strip club, tell em bend it over
Gon give it to her, she been working for it, hey
You gon make a nigga cop a burger for ya, hey
You the bomb, look I got a turban for ya, bae
Beat a nigga til he color purple for ya, babe
Imma murder for you, babe
730 for ya, ay

Swervin', swervin', swervin'
Skrttin', skrttin', skrttin'
Servin', servin', servin'
Everything I done, it comes full circle
Workin', workin', workin', workin'
Swervin', swervin', swervin'
Skrttin', skrttin', skrttin'
Servin', servin', servin'
Everything I done, it comes full circle
Workin', workin', workin', workin'
