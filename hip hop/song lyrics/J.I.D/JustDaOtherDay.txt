[DJ Drama:]
Just the other day it was a dream to make it...
Just the other day, that same dream... they tried to take it...
Just the other day all you wanna do is see them be great...
Just the other day, they look you in your face... eyes full of hate...
(Bobby Kritical)

[J.I.D:]
Just the other day I was goddamn broke
You got a five, I got a five, let's smoke
Just the other day I was running from them folks
Like (ooh, ooh) niggas is too slow
Just the other day I was telling all my bros (woah, woah)
Nigga it's time to go
Just the other day I was goddamn broke

Just the other day I was broke as a bitch
Walking to walk work in the hot Sun, soaking it in
I never been a dope man, but I'm the dopest of man
Buying some smoke from the dude with the dope throw five, four point five, so on, so forth
I'm tryna get my fucking goals, not goyard
Paying for the lawyers, get my bros out the courtyard
Cause I got the ear for the flows, not Mozart, but damn a nigga go hard
Put me on a postcard or miss me til the show start
My niggas got a Benz and he push it like a go-cart
Tryna get one of them, but my ends like "don't start
The bullshit again fore' you end up a broke"
But, again, so don't pretend
Oh we remember, last September, like the coldest winter
Man I really had to show these niggas I owe these niggas a throat slit, know me nigga

Just the other day I was goddamn broke
You got a five, I got a five, let's smoke
Just the other day I was running from them folks
Like (ooh, ooh) niggas is too slow
Just the other day I was telling all my bros (woah, woah)
Nigga it's time to go
Just the other day I was goddamn broke

Today, today, I woke up like this
My girl on my left, no watch on my wrist
Some rings on my fist
What we did last night? Was it a hurricane in here last night?
It would appear that something sexual or severe having being that I see liquor and beer
Weed people still in the living room sleep, come and see
Come and see, she say "I'm dizzy," don't wanna move, just wanna lay under me
Honestly, I know that just other day you was goddamn broke
Watch outside, that nigga shot them folks
Glock in the ride, you gotta watch them folks
And the cops be wilding, we ain't even provoke 'em
I remember being broker than I is right now
Tryna find a place to live, shit I'm is right now
In doubt of my next move, get a pill, bite down, find focus
I grab pen, it was poetry in motion
Not the same for many folks, different strokes, colloquialism
Idiot vision, y'all seen I was doing the most
Definite dope, it's on the scene, not in need of a vote
Repping the city, what's ya team, nigga, fuck 'em
East Atlanta king and I mean every letter
But when I'm good, I'm good, when I'm bad, I'm better
The man of the method, it's a method to the madness
I'm stepping in my bag, with the cannon, step back
Repping the city, showing love that I don't ever get back
But that's the plight of a player, plot an attack and rocking and rapping, rippin' rappers off of the fuckin' map
Suckers suffer, succotash
I need that Mark Zucker bag, Zuckerberg
Hovercraft flows, I don't fuck with that
Bullshit below, from the ceiling to the floor
Full schizo for the dough
New pistol, but I know I'm planting seeds so they can grow
But if they don't, then I don't know

Just the other day I was goddamn broke
You got a five, I got a five, let's smoke
Just the other day I was running from them folks
Like (ooh, ooh) niggas is too slow
Just the other day I was telling all my bros (woah, woah)
Nigga it's time to go
Just the other day I was goddamn broke
