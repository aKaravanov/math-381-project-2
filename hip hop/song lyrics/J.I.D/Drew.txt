You give me two months and I'll make a moon for you
It's still J.I.D. Route, just a little bit smoother
I pray for you
And I know it seems hard
When its crazy in your mind, but you know what's in your heart
At the top of the mountain where the Earth meets God
Seems far but
I pray for you
Seems far but
I pray for you, I pray for you
Seems hard
I pray for you
Seems far but
I pray for you

And I know you hate the sight of me
And everything I sit, jump, and stand for
But when you see me you know I'm doing good
Didn't mean to leave your world dismantled
Or you would say shambles
Gave ample time to blow out the candles
On to the next chick, thought it was a scandal
Now on to my ex something shorty couldn't handle
Its crazy but, I pray for you
And to those who wish I never make it
Hope you know I'm forever praying
Not for no jewelry or no wrist bracelets
But that I can change lives in my heaven placement
At the gates I, I pray for you, I pray for you
Don't stray, you'll make it, I'll make it too
I pray for you, I pray for you
You knew it, the fact that I'm a human
Mistakes, I'ma do it, pursue it, I pray for you
I pray for you, I pray for you

Double triple joining souls step in
Step hoes step left, right directions
No hoes left
Show me something
Show me something
Show me how to prove my point
Always believed being last is best
Give me last
Even if you give me least I'll give complete
Why not?
Feeling this intrinsic interdependance
You knew me before your fingers had tips
And your tips had prints
And your prints had grooves
You knew
We know
You knew
We know
Even if no one else had the bag
Scars sustained
And cuts suspended
Completely free from both sides of the word "then"
Feel this reciprocity
Why not?
Worst case I'm back to first base
Woo
Hold me no confusion
Hold me no illusion
Promise is not on purpose
Purpose is not promise
Promise is not on purpose
I'll pray for you

Yah, four hundred something years
So many tears that it could start an ocean
Not to dwell in the past 'cause I live in the moment
You gotta know where you been to see where you goin'
See where I'm goin'?
The hoodies black for a reason
The clothes all black for a reason
You probably just gotta see it
You hate that God called his angels back for a reason
Shit happens, reactions and actions
But still I pray for you, I promise I'll pray for you
Don't stress, you'll make it, I'll make it too
Because I'll pray for you, I promise I'll pray for you
Don't stress, you'll make it, I'll make it too
Yeah
