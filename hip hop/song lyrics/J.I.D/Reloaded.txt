I'm just adjusting the proper presets to set the tone
Settle down, set in stone
Gather round, cop a squat
You should have an idea what this about
I was tryna be a little better than before I was
The king that I am before I was
The guy I is to-now, tonight, to-now
To write, to verbs, to fuck, to curve, to live, to die
To seize the day, to ease the pain, I breathe a J
To live, to love, to life you lay, you lie, you down, you suck, you flesh, you fucked, it's cool, I'm fed, I'm up
I shed my tusk, you touch my ting, get bled and bust, get fed and bruh, you gotta chill with the extra
Boy, I'm gettin' hungry and the rap game a restaurant
Tummy hurting now, where the restroom?
Sneeze, cough, fart, nigga bless you
Call all of my white friends 'nigga' because I'm ethical
Ever got beat with a bat until you turned vegetable?
Had some beef now he broccoli inside the medical
All over jokes and ridicule
The pedestal set, incredible shit, the belly was sick, his mind was glitched, he let off a clip
Him hit, him miss, him hit, him spit this chick beautiful, by standing witness
Damn all on some bitch shit
Nigga came from poor, can I have some more? on my Oliver Twist shit
Oliver Twist spliffs cuz he fuck with the big shit
Whippin' a Bisquick for a sniff of the lit lit
My nigga change drugs now he change drawers
Also from winter to fall, you got a cough? He slang Halls
I bought one of them thangs that bring coffins
Fox 5, my nigga, coffins

Ok now what makes a motherfucker gangster?
Pull up on the scene with the banger, no please and no thank you's
Or is it that strong nigga that take care of his family?
Fuck the scene up and then take care of the damages
Shoots ring out, the whole spot start scrambling
They got range, them bullets Anthony Hamilton
With bad aim, them killers from off of Candler and Campbellton
From the East to the West, long trip in the ambulance

That's a long trip, a long trip in the ambulance (Eastside to Stone Mountain)
That's a long trip, a long trip in the ambulance
That's a long trip, a long trip in the ambulance (Cascade to Bouldercrest, a long way)
That's a long trip, a long trip in the ambulance

I say hakuna matata
Not worried, you can do nada
I dip my shoters in Prada, you can get dropped in that Aquafina
Fela in my speakers, I'm so surprised you can see us
See us, see it from afar, don't throw a rock at a star
If I'm Aladdin, I would've just pulled the Glock on Jafar
I'm hittin licks and I'm flippin it, come and shop with the boy
She doing dicks and she pretty lit but I'm straight on it tho
You make a living, you cool with it, I can't hate on it tho
Y'all niggas need to get your motherfucking mind right
Nigga light me, hit you from the blind side
Toss 3, get clipped like a mine site
Don't drip blood on concrete
Damn, gin drop by the sunlight
Been a long day and a long night
Damn, always something, right?
Never chill, can't relate
Do it again, back to back
Back to back, back to back
I love practice, practice crack but the shit I do, you can't practice that damn
Damn did it again
There I go, shitted again
Go places I shouldn't have been
Then again

Alright now what make a motherfucker gangster?
Pull up on the scene with the banger, no please and no thank you's
Or is it that strong nigga that take care of his family?
Fuck the scene up and then take care of the damages
Shots ring out, the whole spot start scrambling
They got range, them bullets Anthony Hamilton
With bad aim, them niggas up off Candler and Campbellton
From the East to the West, long trip in the ambulance

That's a long trip, long trip in the ambulance
That's a long trip, long trip in the ambulance
That's a long trip, long trip in the ambulance
That's a long trip, long trip in the ambulance
