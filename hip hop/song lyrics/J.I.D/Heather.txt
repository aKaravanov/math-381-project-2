That was locked in a box, outside, the reflect of the clock
That was on my wall, aw dog, you been thinkin' a lot
Drinkin' a lot of the lean and smokin' the pot
Heather swallowed my dick and called it her black cock
And said that she'll be back so don't tax for the crack rock
And I'm like, "you could bet not," better get you some snapshots
In your mind of some type 'cause I'm a stand up type of guy
You'll be surprised what these bitches'll do
Keep my blunts rolled, pronto, even give me they soul
If you don't know then I know what you didn't befo'
Are you convinced that I'm the prince that told that y'ain't know?
Sorry, didn't mean to fool ya, but yeah I'm the manure
Can I get a Hallelujah? Baby it's Michael Jr
Sorry, didn't mean to fool ya, but baby I'm the manure
Can I get a Hallelujah? 'Cause bitch it's Michael Jr

Yeah, I seen your face real big on the poster
[?] out, now it serves as a coaster
Live mixtape, download it to a folder
Play it, delete it, shit was slowin' up my modem
Hop you quick enough to dodge the shots niggas throwin'
Head, shoulders, arm, back, stomach, scrotum
Oh, but we ain't done yet, we bustin' 'til the sunset
Let's get a little deeper, we ain't even havin' fun yet
L.E. said I'm humble as fuck and I could stunt
Be loud, smellin' myself, shit, I'll leave it to my blunt
Once I'm done with this flow, I'll leave it to a dust
Let 'em fuck it up, cocaine your nose with a uppercut
Fuck is up? Feelin' so anti-sober
In NY looking for leaf like a clover
[?] what you wan' do
Do what your mind can't do, finna go on the run though, holla

Bang, bang, whoever thought you'd find
A iller group of niggas who was rollin' in the same gang
Been goin' balls to the walls, now it's time to let my nuts hang
And I'm still hustling, niggas still tryin' to jock the slang
And they bitch is lookin' for a cock to swing on
Go up and down, get they stock exchange on
The ride get rough so hang on, and I just do me
And I'm so Lati' I could fuck around and get my sang on
Ah Ahem, like
U-N-I-T-Y, and we all equal but if you and I was ever tied
Then I prob'ly wasn't doin' somethin' right
Like when I piss and hiccup at the same time
And then I hit your chick up like, "What you doin' tonight?"
And then she send me pictures of that ass, so that ass in disguise
You know she doin' the plank on the vine
Where you plank on the wood while the guy's in recline
I think it's called the ride to the sky
I ain't really sure, I just heard it was tight
Damn, what's with the evil eye?
I'm chill, no I'm not a evil guy
Not a fan of lettin' all that bullshit fly y'all jump on
I just like to lead, want to follow? Then come on
Y'all chose the same path, I found another to run on
And when I get on top I got a lot of niggas to stunt on
