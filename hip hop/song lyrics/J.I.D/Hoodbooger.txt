If my nine stop busting, imagine me with a shotty
Imagine me with your shorty
Bumping "God's Whisper" by Raury
Probably be with your

Yeah, too many hoes on my D-I-C-K
I run the game like V-I-C-K
You ain't talking shit, no habla ingles
I can cock that thing back and pon de replay
I'ma be the man, and I know that you feel it
Fast-forward, in five years in L.A. in a Bentley
I been a Renaissance, finna send a bomb
Hit him in his arm, leg, head, nigga swam oceans for the commas
Oh my Jésus, the tops in the gray coupe
And when you hit the gas, that shit growl like a gray wolf
I'm murdering the game like Beowulf, what you saying?
You 'bout to get slayed, hop out the roof with the woof

Boy, I be happy with nothing, imagine me if I got it
Say if my nine stop busting, imagine me with the shotty
I been pushing this Pontiac, imagine me in the 'Rari
Bumping "God's Whisper" by Raury, probably be with a shorty
It's probably Tuesday night, she probably pull up at Follies
I probably pop me a, nah, she probably pop her a molly

Twenty-three dollars in my pockets, I'm rich as fuck
'Cause my nigga just hit me from the pen and I hooked him up
Fast-forward ten years, we hopping out of the matte black truck
Black lips, dark abyss in my cup
Wrist sick 'cause I shit like "2 Bitches, 1 Cup"
You a witness, I been had bitches like Pac and Clinton
I Ibaka your shot to give dick to Ms. Hilson
Do the "Pretty Girl Rock" with this shit in your kidneys
Blow the clit to oblivion, guess I'm talking belligerent
Head off, I'm so ignorant, please state your significance
Ain't no harmony, thug, but my bone is the busiest
Hit my phone, I'm lonely inside expensive interior
