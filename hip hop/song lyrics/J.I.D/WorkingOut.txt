On everything I gave everything and got nothing back
Ain't looking for no pat on backs that ain't how we got where the fuck we at
Mama called "where the fuck you at?" "on the road, and I ain't coming back"
Until my hundred stacks make a hundred racks, and that hundred racks bring a bundle back
I was blowin' gas like the honey badger, J.I.D bitch, the money snatcher
C'est la vie shit I'm coming after everybody don't get the bloody splatter
I'm fly and I got my niggas fly too shit is like buddy passes
I wanna cry 'cause I'm numb inside, you wonder why? Ask "What's the matter?"

'Cause I been working hella hard
Shit ain't really working out
I been praying to the Lord
Shit ain't really working out
I been looking to the stars
Keep my head up in the clouds
Shit ain't really working out
Shit ain't really working out
Shit ain't really working out

Okay, shit ain't really working out
Now I got a little bread, got my niggas working outta town
Baby your ass fat, I can see you working out
And you got a new job? Tell me, how that shit working out?
Heard you doing pretty good, yeah, people talk, word of mouth
Wasn't 'round when you had the dirty house, now they won't leave when you kick 'em out
These type of people can't stick around, only down when there's liquor 'round or the spliff around
That's why I don't fuck with niggas now, well I fuck with all my niggas, you know the difference
You been living with tunnel vision, you and all of your friends are like wonder women, Wonder Woman
Working for it if you ever wanted something, searching for a purpose, I see what you on
Difference in how you be using your gifts in the midst of the shit that you dealing with, really specific
You pay attention, panoramic, got the vision like a fer-de-lance, you attack and you kill it
Sinkin' your teeth with the venom, kinda like me with these instrumentals
Or the pen and the pencil, or off the pimpin' since been pimpin', keep it sensible
Since you winning you a object of ridicule, objects appearing closer than you ready for
Obviously you don't know what's ahead but that's the reason you can work 'til you get it

I been working hella hard
Shit ain't really working out
I been praying to the Lord
Shit ain't really working out
I been looking to the stars
Keep my head up in the clouds
Shit ain't really working out
Shit ain't really working out
Shit ain't really working out

C'mon bruh, come to the booty club one time
Throw some of that Dreamville money
