Sorry I don't give a fuck about no college shit
They couldn't keep me in that bitch with a scholarship
I would've been the Dali Lama or like Don Lemon
But I'm Dicaprio, digging my inner Bart Simpson
The bitch fine
I'm breast smelling and toe sniffing
I just look at you like you art
I cry books of garth
I know that she prolly leave
And break my achy breaky heart
But I don't care cause I don't need that organ
Probably find that shit again when I have me a daughter
But with my karma I probably have forty four of them
One son
Little one son
Japanese mom
Beyonce
But if you jump dumb
I turn your ass to Willy Lump Lump
Left silly slumped
Rap game, Willy Wonka
Need a ticket or a sponsor
I'm just coming through your monitors
Sitting in your kitchen
While your momma in her pajamas
Making eggs for your brother and your father
Go to school now
Gym locker room
Little buddy got the tool
We ain't telling, shit's cool till he busting at you
I was just thinking I could die or get some dust on my shoes
From running, but these my favs
I should walk the other way
See, me and God had a long talk the other day
He just told me some jokes
And told me I can lead the way
Told me I could make the change
But, that's all I gotta say

Been a long day
Smoke until my head hurt
Running all the way
Putting in the leg work
Rolling up the paper
Take a shot of Jager
Shawty wan me swam in the pussy like a sailor
Shorty from Chicago
She love obla
Hotbox cars smoking out the whole block
John pull me over
We don't fuck with no cop
We don't stop
We don't fuck with roadblocks

Baby got the ass like SZA
Long ass hair
Wanna beat like the RZA
She just want joke like the Riddler
But if I puzzle this little picture
She probably end up with dick near her appendix
Ooh splendid
Now I gotta buy her shiny shit
Dyslexic she tryna do the 96
Wanna come to a G spot bitch
Find this shit
Tryna tell me you the bomb
Like I don't mine and shit
I been all across the world
On my grind and shit
Sticky bud in my grinder
Can't grind this shit
Suck a dick on your Insta and Vine
But its words you want
And I promise I ain't got a dime
Look at God while you crying
I ain't dying for a record to sell
Beef not getting the money
So it's selfish as hell to the squad
Anyways, if I was there I never could fail
Cause JID major childish, Petty Labelle
Sqeaky voice, but the flow hold steady as hell
My wordplay wordly and I ate the gazelle
The other day and the girl, her name was Giselle
It was easy as hell, she was a jezebel
Yeah, uh
I go an split a short with my shorty
Little tired, she been riding, Kentucky Derby
Little God bless this strong and hold it sturdy
Hold that shit down I don't wanna catch a murdy
Ovua, merci
I never been in a Testarossa
But I throw this dick like Testaverde
All of them heard me
JID so nouny and verby
Talking about pussy pounding and slurping
Wait...

Been a long day

We don't stop
We don't fuck with roadblocks...
