Savage, hard-head living
Devil on my shoulder, I can't see him, I just feel him
God is my witness, focus vision, keep a distance
Dream motion living, being broke got me livid
Bitches after bitches, all my niggas 2Pac
Speaking revolution or that shit that might get you shot
Threatened like I'm Biggie
Kicking like I'm Ong Bak
Bitches love Jid 'cause I got three legs and two socks

[Curtis Williams:]
I smoke more than I eat
Drink more than I sleep
I fuck more than I love girl, so wassup?
Is you freaky?
I smoke more than I eat
Drink more than I sleep
I fuck more than I love girl, so wassup?
Is you freaky?
I smoke more than I eat
Drink more than I sleep
I fuck more than I love girl, so wassup?
Is you freaky?
I smoke more than I eat
(You so crazy, you so crazy, you so crazy)
Drink more than I sleep
I fuck more than I love girl, so wassup?
Is you freaky?

Savages, let's get back to business
I was bumping Webbie, webbing through what's in his vision
Realize the image, was nothing like myself
Became something different, I ain't nothing like no one else
Funny I would say that, sorry that you didn't
Sorry woman, sorry nigga, I feel sorry for your kiddies
I can't keep it artificial
I official, all the whistles
I won't even argue with you
I'm so high, it's all medicinal
Imma get you high
Pull up on a lones and it get you shot
Talk a little shit brrr pop pop
Still called your nigga like Jid Joe Pa, but is Jid Joe Pa
Yeah no naw
I just fuck, I hit no raw
Them talk slick, I twist your jaw
No boys on leash don't tempt no dog
All I gotta do is let 'em off the wrist though
10 4 niggas shooting from the hip so
Shut eye I can shoot 'em from a disco
Niggas shooting on the blitz tho
Touchdown, had to throw the ball to Christo
Nigga had to get ghost
Me talking shit, broke, pissed and paranoid I'm grabbing on my pistol
My bull in a dismal state for dismissal I dipped my dick in gold girl who sent you?
Tell my dick don't get too hard, we out in public being stars
I would just take you to my whip
Fucked a bitch, flipped a car
Ridin slab, sipping bar
I heard it from a G before, I always knew I'd be a star
Had to talk, me and God
Told me there was two types of people, me and yall
Sorry I ain't seeing y'all, it's gonna take like 33 of y'all
45s at 4-5 am, no I ain't sleep at all
Ask me why I go so hard
Ask me why I flow so hard
I ain't tripping, I just ask them niggas what team they going for
