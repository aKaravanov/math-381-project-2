[Kanye West:]
Look at you [14x]
Look at you [8x]
Ladies and gentlemen, la-ladies and gentlemen

And I always find, yeah, I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast

Let's have a toast for the douchebags,
Let's have a toast for the assholes,
Let's have a toast for the scumbags,
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerk-offs
That'd never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can

She find pictures in my e-mail
I sent this bitch a picture of my dick.
I don't know what it is with females
But I'm not too good at that shit.
See, I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hood rats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know that's what I'm good at

And I always find
Yeah, I always find,
Yeah, I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast

Let's have a toast for the douchebags,
Let's have a toast for the assholes,
Let's have a toast for the scumbags,
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerk-offs
That'd never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can

Run away from me, baby
Run away
Run away from me, baby
(Look at you, look at you, look at you)
Run away
When it starts to get crazy
(Look at you, look at you, look at you)
Just run away
Baby I got a plan
Run away as fast as you can

Run away from me, baby
Run away
Run away from me, baby
(Look at, look at, look at, look at, look at, look at, look at you)
Run away
When it starts to get crazy
(Look at you, look at you, look at you)
Why can't she just, run away?
Baby I got a plan
Run away fast as you can

[Pusha T:]
24/7, 365, pussy stays on my mind
I-I-I-I did it
All right, all right, I admit it
Now pick your next move, you could leave or live with it
Ichabod Crane with that motherfuckin' top off
Split and go where? Back to wearin' knock-offs, ha, ha?
Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off
Let's talk over Mai Tais, waitress, top it off
Hoes like vultures, wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes with a price tag, baby, face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty hoes in a baller-nigga matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless
P!

[Kanye:]
Never was much of a romantic,
I could never take the intimacy.
And I know I did damage,
'Cause the look in your eyes is killing me,
I guess you knew in an advantage
'Cause you could blame me for everything.
And I don't know how I'mma manage,
If one day you just up and leave
And I always find yeah, I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast

Let's have a toast for the douchebags,
Let's have a toast for the assholes,
Let's have a toast for the scumbags,
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerk-offs
That'd never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can
