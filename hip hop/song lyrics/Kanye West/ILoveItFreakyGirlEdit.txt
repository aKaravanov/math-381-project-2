'Cause you know in the old days
They couldn't say the sh.. they wanted to say
They had to fake orgasms and sh..
We can tell ..iggas today:
"Hey, I wanna.."

[Lil Pump & Kanye West:]
You're such a freaky girl, I love it (I love it)
You're such a freaky girl, I love it (I love it)

You're such a freaky girl, I love it (love it, love it)
Your boyfriend is a dork, McLovin (dork)
(McLovin; ooh, ooh, ooh)
I just pulled up in a Ghost (Ghost)
That—that—ch up out in London (up out in)
Then I f—d up on her cousin
Or her sister, I don't know nothin' (uh-uh, woo)
And my ni—as gettin' ignorant
Like a lighter, we—we ignant (ignant)
All this water on my neck
Look like I fell when I went fishin' (fell!)
So much diamonds on my bust down
Ooh, uhf—what's the time? (where we at?)
Me and Smokepurpp sippin' pinch (Purpp!)
Ooh, uhf, she take lines (lines)

You're such a freaky girl, I love it (I love it, scoop!)
You're such a freaky girl, I love it (I love it)

[Kanye West:]
You're such a freaky girl
When the first time they ask you if you want sparklin' or still?
Why you tryna act like you was drinkin' sparklin' water 'fore you came out here?
You're such a freaky..

I'm a real freak, I need a real freak (whoop!)
I'm a real freak, I need a real freak (whoop!)
I'm a real freak, I need a real freak (whoop!)
I'm a real freak, I need a real freak (whoop!)
I'm a sick pup, I like a quick jump
I'll light your wrist up, I'll buy you a sick truck
I'll buy you some new gifts, I'll get you that nip-tuck
How you start a family? The condom slipped up
I'm a sick puppy, I'm inappropriate
I like hearin' stories, I like the whole script
Like where your clothes went before you post it?
Send me some mo' pics, you look nice for four kids...

You're such a freaky girl, I love it (I love it)
You're such a freaky girl, I love it (I love it)
