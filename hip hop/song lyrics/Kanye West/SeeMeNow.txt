[Beyoncé:]
I got my suit and tie
And I don't know if y'all know
Well, maybe y'all do
Or maybe y'all don't
But I don't really care
It's how we on it all the time
So I'mma get my money
Let's go

[Kanye West:]
Now, I'mma need you to kill the hypocrisy
This is an aristocracy
I'm Socrates, but my skin more chocolaty
What's up with who? That's old news
I'm in a speedboat, in my boat shoes
Huh? I swear my whole collection's so cool
I might walk in Nobu with no shoes
He just walked in Nobu like it was Whole Foods!
That nigga crazy, I told you!
Immature adult (uh huh), insecure asshole (what else?)
And if you fall on the concrete, that's yo' ass fault
If you pass on a Kon beat, that's yo' last fault
Get what you ask for, I swear that's yo' ass, so
She got a big booty, but she couldn't drop that ass low
'Til you take yo' last ho, and rope up all the cash flow
When you gettin' money, they be all up on yo' ass, yo
When you gettin' money cops don't let a nigga pass go
Straight to jail, yo, in a hell hole
Right next to Lucifer, tell 'im I say, "Hello."
Ask him if I'mma be there soon and tell 'im I said, "Hell, no!"
Yo, what you say when your people get out of jail, huh?

[Beyoncé (Kanye West):]
My niggas is home
I guess I got everything
Everything I want
(Let's go shopping dog, let's celebrate)
But I don't
No matter how good it gets
(Free Weezy though)
It'll never be like before
No women in the crowd
Screamin' and it's loud
Doin' things not allowed
And I swear it's goin' down right now
(You know what it is)
I know one thing, my mama would be proud
And you see me lookin' up
'Cause I know she's lookin' down right now

[Kanye West:]
Pour the champagne, let your watch show
Shorty got a man watch, wrist look colossal
I admit my first watch was a Fossil
Now I'm in the Louvre, lookin' for fossils
Attention to detail is so uncanny
And the whip's on the Sprewells, it's so un-Camry
Somebody need to put us on camera
The world of Rollies and everyone families
Stay Jordan fresh, suits and Ferraris
Cute, your shorty watch Barney's, we head to Bonny's
End up at Marni, Giorgio, service from Sergio Tacchini
Lamborghini, the chain throw off the vertigo
I know the flow just hit a hellified vertical
This the Christ year, last year was magic, thirty-two
Lyrically, can't none of y'all murder 'Ye
'Cause y'all raps ain't got no vertebrae
I got style ask June if she heard of me
I killed the fur last Paris, raised the murder rate
First of all, we all know the beats is
Like a mix between Fergie and Jesus
Imagine the direction of this immaculate conception
Every one of His Majesty's swim parties is pageantries
Cannonball off the diving board when I am bored
All my homies GDs, but I am Lord
Rap god, Greek mythology
And this life too crazy to think logically
Here's something that you could use as an analogy
My life is like a child's illusions become reality

[Beyoncé:]
Now go get my throne
'Cause I don't wanna stop
I just go in my zone
And I'mma make it hot
'Til it's time to go
When it's time to go
Where you tryna go?
You better act like you can see me now
(Exactly!)
(Rosewood)
