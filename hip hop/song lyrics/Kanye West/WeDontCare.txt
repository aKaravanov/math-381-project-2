[Kanye West:]
And all my people that's drug dealing just to get by
Stack your money 'til it gets sky high
We wasn't supposed to make it past 25
Joke's on you we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky
And say "We don't care what people say"

If this is your first time hearing this 
You are about to experience something so cold man
We never had nothing handed
Took nothing for granted
Took nothing from no man, man I'm my own man

But as a shorty I looked up to the dopeman
Only adult man I knew that wasn't broke man
Flicking Starter coats man, man you don't know man
We don't care what people say

This is for my niggas outside all winter
'Cause this summer they ain't finna say, "Next summer I'm finna."
Sitting in the hood like community colleges
This dope money here is Lil Trey's scholarship

'Cause ain't no tuition for having no ambition
And ain't no loans for sitting your ass at home
So we forced to sell crack rap and get a job
You gotta do something man your ass is grown

[Kanye West:]
Drug dealing just to get by
Stack your money 'til it gets sky high
Kids sing, kids sing

[Kanye and kids:]
We wasn't supposed to make it past 25
Joke's on you we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky
And say "We don't care what people say"

The second verse is for my dogs working 9-to-5
That still hustle 'cause a nigga can't shine off $6.55
And everybody selling make-up, Jacob's
And bootleg tapes just to get they cake up
We put shit on layaway then come back
We claim other people kids on our income tax
We take that money cop work then push packs to get paid
And we don't care what people say

Mamma say she wanna move South 
Scratching lottery tickets eyes on a new house
Around the same time Doe ran up in dude's house 
Couldn't get a job
So since he couldn't get work he figured he'd take work

The drug game bulimic it's hard to get weight
So nigga's money is homo it's hard to get straight
But we gon' keep baking 'til the day we get cake
And we don't care what people say 

[Kanye West and kids:]
My niggas drug dealing just to get by
Stack your money 'til it gets sky high
Kids sing, kids sing
We wasn't supposed to make it past 25
The joke's on you we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky
And say "We don't care what people say"

You know the kids gon' act a fool
When you stop the programs for after school
And they DCFS some of them dyslexic
They favorite 50 Cent song's 12 Questions

We scream, rock, blows, weed park 
See now we smart
We ain't retards the way teachers thought
Hold up hold fast we make more cash
Now tell my mamma I belong in that slow class 

Sad enough we on welfare
You tryna put me on the school bus with the space for the wheel chair
I'm tryna get the car with the chromy wheels here
You tryna cut our lights out like we don't live here

Look at what's handed us our father's abandoned us
When we get them hammers go and call the ambulance
Sometimes I feel no one in this world understands us
But we don't care what people say
