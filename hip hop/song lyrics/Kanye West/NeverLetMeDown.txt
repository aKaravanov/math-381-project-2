Told you I won't let you down
Told you I won't let this rap game change me, right?

When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found,one thing I found
Oh no you'll never let me down,
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)

[Jay-Z:]
Yo, yo first I snatched the street then I snatched the charts,
First I had their ear now I have their heart,
Rappers came and went,
I've been here from the start,
Seen them put it together
Watched them take it apart,
See the Rovers roll up with ribbons
I've seen them re-poed, re-sold and re-driven
So when I reload, he holds #1 position
When you hot I'm hot
And when your feet cold, mine's is sizzling
It's plain to see
Niggas can't fuck with me
'cause I'mma be that nigga for life
This is not an image
This is God-given
This is hard living
Mixed with Cristal sipping
It's the most consistent
Hov
Give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and
Nigga I'm home on these charts, y'all niggas visiting
It's Hov tradition, Jeff Gordon of rap
I'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya boy

When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found,one thing I found
Oh no you'll never let me down,
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)

I get down for my grandfather who took my momma
Made her sit that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat
At the tender age of 6 she was arrested for the sit in
With that in my blood I was born to be different
Now niggas can't make it to ballots to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacob and to the dealership
That's why I hear new music
And I just don't be feeling it
Racism still alive they just be concealing it
But I know they don't want me in the damn club
They even made me show I.D. to get inside of Sam's club
I did dirt and went to church to get my hands scrubbed
Swear I've been baptised at least 3 or 4 times
But in the land where niggas praise
Yukons and getting paid
It gon' take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than do-rags to get your waves
Nothing sadder than that day my girl father passed away
So I promised to Mr Rany I'm gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you for they way that she was brought up
And I know that you were smiling when you see that car I bought her
And you sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up
But I can't complain what the accident did to my Left Eye
'cause look what an accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah and now Romeo must die
I know I got angels watching me from the other side

When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found,one thing I found
Oh no you'll never let me down,
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)

When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found,one thing I found
Oh no you'll never let me down,
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)

[J.Ivy:]
We are all here for a reason on a particular path
You don't need a curriculum to know that you are part of the math
Cats think I'm delirious, but I'm so damn serious
That's why I expose my soul to the globe, the world
I'm trying to make it better for these little boys and girls
I'm not just another individual, my spirit is a part of this
That's why I get spiritual, but I get my hymns from Him
So it's not me, it's He that's lyrical
I'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven-sent instrument
My rhythmatic regimen navigates melodic notes for your soul and your mental
That's why I'm instrumental
Vibrations is what I'm into
Yeah, I need my loot by rent day
But that is not what gives me the heart of Kunte Kinte
I'm tryna give us "us free" like Cinque
I can't stop, that's why I'm hot
Determination, dedication, motivation
I'm talking to you, my many inspirations
When I say I can't, let you or self down
If I were of the highest cliff, on the highest riff
And you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life in my grip
I would never, ever let you down
And when these words are found
Let it been known that God's penmanship has been signed with a language called "Love"
That's why my breath is felt by the deaf
And why my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
I, too, dream in color and in rhyme
So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house
'cause whenever I open my heart, my soul, or my mouth
A touch of God reigns out

When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found,one thing I found
Oh no you'll never let me down,
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)

[Jay-Z (Kanye West):]
Who else you know been hot this long,
(Oh Ya, you know we ain't finished)
Started from nothing but he got this strong,
(The ROC is in the building)
Built the ROC from a pebble, pedaled rock before I met you,
Pedaled bikes, got my nephews pedal bikes because they special,
Let you tell that man I'm falling,
Well somebody must've caught him,
'Cause every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan 'em,
Number one albums, what I got like four of them,
More of them on the way,
The Eight Wonder on the way,
Clear the way, I'm here to stay,
Y'all can save the chitter chat, this and that, this and Jay,
Dissin' Jay will get you maced,
When I start spitting them lyrics, niggas get very religious,
Six Hail Maries, please Father forgive us,
Young, the Archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggas,
The way y'all all follow Jigga,
Hov's a living legend and I tell you why,
Everybody wanna be Hov and Hov still alive.
