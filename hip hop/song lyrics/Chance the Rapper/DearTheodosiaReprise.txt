[Chance The Rapper:]
Dear Theodosia, what to say to you?
You have my eyes. You have your mother's name
When you came into the world, you cried and it broke my heart

I'm dedicating every day to you
Domestic life was never quite my style
When you smile
You knock me out, I fall apart
And I thought I was so smart

You will come of age with our young nation
We'll bleed and fight for you, I'll make it right for you
If we lay a strong enough foundation
We'll pass it on to you, I'll give the world to you

And you'll blow us all away
Someday, someday
Yeah, you'll blow us all away

[Francis and the Lights (Chance The Rapper):]
Oh Philip, when you smile I am undone, my son
Look at my son. Pride is not the word I'm looking for
There is so much more inside me now

Oh Philip, you outshine the morning sun, my son
And when you smile, I fall apart
And I thought I (was so smart)

[Chance The Rapper {Francis and the Lights} (both):]
(My father wasn't around)
My father wasn't around
{I swear that} (I'll be around for you)
{I'll do whatever it takes}
I'll make a million mistakes
{I'll make the} (world safe and sound for you...)

[Chance The Rapper (Francis and the Lights):]
Oooh (Oooh)
We'll bleed and fight for you (Oooh)
We'll make it right for you (Oooh)
(Whatever it takes)

If we lay a strong enough foundation (Ooh, so make)
We'll pass it on to you (The world safe and sound for you)
We'll give the world to you
And you'll blow us all away (Someday, someday
Someday, someday)

Someday
Someday (The world safe and sound)

Yeah you'll blow us all away (I'll make the world safe and sound)
(For you)

Someday
Oooh (Someday)
Someday	 (Someday)

We'll make the world safe and sound for you
Someday
You will know you're strong enough foundation
One day
Someday
