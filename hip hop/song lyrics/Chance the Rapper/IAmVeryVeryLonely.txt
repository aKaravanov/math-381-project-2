[Verse 1:]
It’s just me and la cucaracha tonight
Cold pizza with the hot Sriracha tonight
Apple TV, Comcast, don’t know what to watch-a tonight
Shoulda had ya when I had ya, now I wish I gotcha tonight

[Hook x2:]
You can hit my line
If you ain’t on shit, if you tryna smoke

[Verse 2:]
I guess I'll file the cabinets, fix the disha washa, tonight (lot of activities)
Feed the fishes twist a swisha while I mix the pasta tonight (multitasking)
Tube socks white briefs gold wrista watcha tonight (fancy attire)
On the sofa posted perfect selfie picture posture tonight (Snapchat bitch)

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
This is not the castle this is just the casa tonight
Ain’t no Nala so my Simba ain't gon’ be Mufasa tonight
Only dust and shadows comin' from la cucaracha tonight
But if you eva in the hood like Mr. Rogers, hit my

[Hook]
