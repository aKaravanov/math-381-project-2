Big ol' booty gotta jump, gotta juke me
Gotta plan, gotta duty
Gotta dance, gotta boogie
I'm a fan, gotta stan
Gotta cam, it's a movie
Make my 'gram look like Cannes, like in France
My momma, my mamma mia
Tell me what your momma feeds you
You getting that cornbread and choreo
Let me throw you on the story though
Trying to be like story mode
You belong on the war zone on
Wala, Wala

Wala, Wala, Wala, Wala, Wala, Wala, Wala, Wala
Wala, Wala, Wala, Wala, Wala, Wala, Wala, Wala

Nigga you can't dance
My feet like my hands
Your feet like quicksand
Something I can't stand
Something I just hate
I'm not on no date
Car don't got no roof
Works, don't got no brake
Girl don't got no waist
Watch don't got no face
Jet don't got no plates
God don't got no cape
Shoes don't got no J's
Don't got no style, don't got no taste
Bank don't got no card, don't got quickpay, don't got no Chase

Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam

Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam
Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam
Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam, Wala Cam

[Supa Bwe:]
Watching DBZ
Shorty stuck to me
Like she lowkey USB
I just want some head, want some lowkey guillotine
Police watching me like I'm lowkey new TV
Like I'm serving twenty p's
Like I lowkey used to be
Over the seas with my girl cause she over achieving
Don't put nobody over her king
Love my life
Shorty ride my face like bike
I'ma beat it like Mike, not Ike
My spliff broke, shit! oh life
I might spent on you
All year, all night
I might some fuck some ads up
Or fuck your mans up
I might fuck some bands up
Switch the plan up
Leave the country like right now
Shit, I might go flight
I might take off tonight
I might, I might, I might
Tonight I might

You need name tag
She got the same ass
Same drawers, same car
Same bag, damn fraud
Shake it up, shake it up, shake it up, shake it up
Pop pop pop that cork
Pop it like July 4th
Shorty don't move like yours
She get it from a store
You get it from the Stork
They don't do this up North
They always end it [?]
