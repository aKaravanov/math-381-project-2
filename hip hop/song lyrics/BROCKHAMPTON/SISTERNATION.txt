[Merlyn Wood:]
Drink, got the alcopop with it, yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't got no chains in my denim, yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't listen what the blogs tell me, yeah, yeah, yeah
I know niggas got their own agenda, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Joba:]
I've got [*beep*] but she would never know
I like to hide them, so much I lose myself
That's why I'm pure to some, a psychopath to others
And grew up in counselling, flippin' off my counselors
They gave me mood stabilisers but when I came off 'em I was violent
Took the drugs that I wanted which didn't help with the voices
They just grew louder and louder
They called the people who'd just chatter and chatter
I juggle all my personalities

[Robert Ontenient:]
"Estoy tan harto y cansado, no puedo seguir asíendo esto ojalá pudiera rendir me pero tengo seguir siendo fuerte para mi familia y mis amigos"

[Kevin Abstract:]
I find myself gettin' better by the fuckin' minute
Number one, my momma always had to save the minutes
Got some D's dropped out wanted to be Russell Simmons
Gotta keep workin', my head or in a vision
Where the kitchen at? Keep the lyrics written
Raid my cell and dope, askin' for forgiveness
I just turn into somebody sellin' lemonade
Kiss your kiss and then before them bitches, run away

Get your man, get your man all up off me
Back again, 100 bands around me
In December, I don't care what they call me

This for all my bro niggas, this for all them drugs, nigga
That you niggas made when I was still livin' at home, nigga
Did it on my own, nigga, grew up and I bossed out
Grew up and I bossed out, grew up and I bossed out

[Matt Champion:]
I see you peekin' through bushes and tryna get secret ingredients from us
I know that you do it 'cause you see us
Boomin' like C4 when you hit that detonator
Lucky lucky on the elevator
Eat my dust baby I'll see ya later
I could always call your bluff
You already said enough
Take a risk bitch still sitting on your ass
Waiting for a handout
Giving nothin' put your hands down
Ooh yeah, this for the culture
Ooh yeah, this important
Fuck off with that slang shit
Fuck off with that networking
Keep ya mouth where the money at

[Dom Mclennon:]
Yellow lights on my dashboard, red flags in the rearview
I know I'm the one that made you upset, but all I wanna do is see you
You know that lately I don't think straight, but I don't really know what I'm doing now
'Cause everybody got me fucked up, I'm struggling while on the move now
Yellow lights on my dashboard, red flags in the rearview
I know I'm the one that made you upset, but all I wanna do is see you
You know that lately I don't think straight, but lately I don't know what to do now
'Cause everybody got me fucked up, I'm struggling while on the move now

[Kevin Abstract:]
Get your man, get your man all up off me
Back again, 100 bands around me
In December, I don't care what they call me
Get your man, get your man all up off me
Back again, 100 bands around me
In December, I don't care what they call me
Get your man, get your man all up off me
Back again, 100 bands around me
In December, I don't care what they call me
Get your man, get your man all up off me
Back again, 100 bands around me
In December, I don't care what they call me

[NATION]

[Kevin Abstract:]
Barely got control of it, must've got a hold of it
Threw me to the ground and left a scar right on my nigga lips
I look in the closet when I think about the past life
Never good in my wallet, tryna see if I got my cash right
Fuck a flight, they ain't never wanted to treat my pack right
Fuck a job, they ain't never treat my mom and dad right

[Ameer Vann:]
I hate the quiet suburbs, I hate those picket fences
I hate the separation, first thing they called me: Nigga
I fight, I got suspended
My teachers saw me hit him
So they ain't listen to me, and from that moment on
I would learn that I was different, I would grow to see the difference
Second guessing my decisions, black bodies come up missing

[Kevin Abstract:]
I feel like all my days are coming to rubble
I feel like all my days are coming to rubble

[Dom McLennon:]
I would walk through the halls at my own pace
Every lunch, I would flow, having no place
All the books in my bag till my bones ache
Wonder how the world would be if I had no face
If I had no heart, if I had no skin
And I was just thoughts, reminiscing the things always brushed off
Had my Father tell me I was just off
And when I look at the things that I've been through
And the things I survived and at what cost?
All alone in my life that I just lost
All this shit persevere to the pole vault
In the eyes of the law I'm a problem
In the eyes of blogs I'm a paycheck
In the eyes of the world I'm an icon
In the eyes of my own I ain't start yet
In the eyes of the law I'm a problem
In the eyes of the blogs I'm paycheck
In the eyes of the world I'm an icon
In the eyes that I own I ain't start yet

[Kevin Abstract:]
I feel like all my days are coming to rubble
I feel like all my days are coming to rubble
I feel like all my days are coming to rubble
I feel like all my days are coming to rubble
