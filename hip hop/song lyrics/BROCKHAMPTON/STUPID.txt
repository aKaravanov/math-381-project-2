[Merlyn Wood:]
Merlyn, hoppin' out the 304
I feel like Batman, hanging with directors
'Bout that action so please don't stick with movin' my direction
All I got to lose is my erection

[Ameer Vann (Matt Champion):]
I'm a black man with a deadly weapon (What drug reference, huh?)
I'm a real dog, we all go to heaven
But I been trippin' on the steps and I don't think I'll make it
I'm in this big house, still I'm suffocating

[Matt Champion:]
Carnival, my heart like a Supreme phantom
Goin' hundred speed, blowin' steam, I throw a tantrum
Judging by my face, my eyes slit like a python
I think she might hate me for a lifetime, aye, aye
Daddy crack and red, drunk, you pay for the pipeline
Goin' out the weather, leave my name, I'm goin' offline
I just want my shit to fit, Taylor just like Tiffany
Oh, they say I'm perfect
On my back, oh, man, they killin' me

[Kevin Abstract:]
Boys wanna play with my cell phone but I don't want nobody to see what's in it
Boys wanna play with my cell phone but I don't want nobody to see what's in it
Boys wanna play with my cell phone but I don't want nobody to see what's in it
Boys wanna play with my cell phone but I don't want nobody to see what's in it

[Dom McLennon:]
White burner, black burner
I do not discriminate
I am on a pilgrimage so don't try to insinuate
Building up in instrument to aim it at the human race
Let it off in hopes that all the pain and stress disintegrates
I think you intolerant
When you do the most, it's moderate
I come with that gas that'll make you think I had a doctorate
What we do provocative
I ain't no apologist
Don't step to professionals and books [?]

[Kevin Abstract:]
America's favorite, I do my best and they hate it
It's like I'm stuck in the matrix and I'm stuck losin' patience
While they stuck on they day shift I hate my boyfriend's fragrance
I'm a faggot, I say it, I scream that shit like I mean it
Yeah, I'm ugly and genius
I went from nothing to sleeping on Jon's couch
To makin' people bounce at every show that's sold out
You know who I'm talkin' 'bout
With ghouls all in my dirty mouth
Boys be on that silly shit so Billy 'bout to air 'em out

Boys wanna play with my cell phone but I don't want nobody to see what's in it
Boys wanna play with my cell phone but I don't want nobody to see what's in it
Boys wanna play with my cell phone but I don't want nobody to see what's in it
Boys wanna play with my cell phone but I don't want nobody to see what's in it
