[Joba (Kevin Abstract):]
Your lipstick burns my lips
But I think I'm still in love with you
Your eyes drip black
But I think you're still in love with me
But it feels like there's no air to breathe again (In the pink skies)
And it feels like I'm drowning in love again (I can't swim)
I'm afraid I'll lose all that I have again (Her eyes were red)
But I'm ready for the truth (Love me not)

[Joba:]
I'm so lost in love (la la, la la) [x4]

I've been a fool (ooo, aa-aah)

[Joba (Kevin Abstract):]
You say I care too much
But what does that even mean
You say I need some space
But what does that mean for me
It feels like I've fallen and fell again (The car crash)
And it feels like there's no hope for us again (You were high as hell)
I'm afraid you'll leave me for a better man (I try my hardest)
But I'm ready for the truth (Love me not)

[Joba:]
I'm so lost in love (la la, la la) [x4]

[Joba & Kevin Abstract:]
My head was spinning (I've been a fool)
I lost, I lost it (I've been a fool)
I've been a fool (Ooo, aa-ah)
Aa-ha-haaa
