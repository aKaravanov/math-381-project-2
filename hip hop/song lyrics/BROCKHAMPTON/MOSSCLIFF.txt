[Interlude - Ariel Wendt:]
Through the quicksand, the wind, and the bush in between
Someone has to shine
The boys of the wild found each other during their time of need and chose to turn to each other in order to grow
Learn, learn, share, hope
Running away from home, facing the fears of the real world
Maintaining to hold on to the idea that connected them all, but this is difficult
Challenging, there's something different in the air
The clouds are changing, weapons, love, heartbreak, and everything in between
Dirty, filthy boys
Don't let this one die
