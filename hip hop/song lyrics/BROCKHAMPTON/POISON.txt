[Matt Champion:]
You are just poison
I put that on my grave
No need for aggression
I just need to behave

But your love is poison
I put that on my soul
Pull me down with seduction
I know that you want control

[Ameer Vann:]
You are my drugs
You are what I need
The love of my life
You kiss me, I bleed
At night when I fiend
I'm grinding my teeth
I get high when you speak
If I could jump I could fly
It's so cold in the clouds
But I stay in the sky
And I see you on the ground
I guess it wasn't the same
You know I smoke and you drank
We ain't one in the same
I can't remember your name
But I remember your scent
And I remember your face
And I remember the…
And I remember the days
We wasn't stuck in our ways
Not a subject for change
I'm just a rat in your maze
And your venom's to blame

[Matt Champion:]
You are just poison
I put that on my grave
No need for aggression
I just need to behave

But your love is poison
I put that on my soul
Pull me down with seduction
I know that you want control

Poison [x4]
