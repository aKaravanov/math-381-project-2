Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, yay!

Niggas talk shit, talk a whole lot of shit

[Matt Champion:]
Kiss the shoulder, hop in the Corolla
These bitches talkin' shit like the bottom of porta-potties
Bright ass yellow teeth, you a shit talker
Gossip, legs movin' like a salsa dancer
Drunk, fallin' out ya car like a flaccid dick
Aww man, God damn
What the fuck wrong with ya?
Say it to my face pussy-ass boy
Need an Altoid for your hot breath
Like a hot mess, pop your biceps
Cue the roid rage

[Kevin Abstract:]
I think I got like five more albums inside my mind
This that shit, that do or die
Make your grandmama cry
Keep some baggy jeans on me
Keep a Billie Jean on me
Got that New Orleans on me
Smellin' like a queen to ya

[Dom McLennon:]
Cu-cu-cucumber lemonade
I need something fresh today
Barber make the texture fade
Actin' out like it's charades
Strawberry sweater fleece
Baby give me something sweet
We don't gotta be discrete
Moonwalking between the seats

[Matt Champion:]
Hit on that beat and then stop
Hop on that booty like who the hell cutie
Like I don't know cootie
My momma ain't raise no bitch ass
Ain't no kiss ass, ain't no-
Get the fuck out of my face now [*burp*]
Get the fuck out of my way now
You are so far off my level
Stop!

[Kevin Abstract & Dom McLennon:]
In the barber shop with my niggas, ay
I ain't never soft with my nigga, ay
I ain't never copy no nigga, ay
So quit talkin', bitch nigga (quit yo talkin', bitch) (ay)
Ay, I wanna buy a Jeep, ay
That's my energy
Trilogy, that's history
Southside baby rest in peace!

[Dom McLennon:]
Uh, lordy lordy, testify, yeah
Got explosives in my mind, yeah
Search for feelings I can't find, yeah
I'm a ghost because I grind, yeah
Made a deal with Father Time, yeah
Told me "Find a way to shine", yeah
"I can make you live forever
All you gotta do is dance until you die", yeah

[Kevin Abstract:]
Niggas talk shit, talk a whole lot of shit
Need to stop (quit) talking shit and give us more, more
Niggas talk shit, talk a whole lot of shit
Need to stop talking shit and give us more, more
Niggas talk shit, talk a whole lot of shit
Need to stop (quit) talking shit and give us more, more
Niggas talk shit, talk a whole lot of shit
Need to stop talking shit and give us more, more
