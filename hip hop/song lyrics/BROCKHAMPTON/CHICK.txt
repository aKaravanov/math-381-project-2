He look crazy as hell
But he dress well
Why his face look puff?
Why he look like that?
Why your hair like that?
Why your teeth like that?
Why your cheeks like that?

I got this shitty moustache, and a new haircut
Short, but tall enough to ride every ride so it's fair enough
Teeth crooked but my breath fresh just like the evergreens
My attitude is bit like a psys- fuck!
You mean a psychopath
I bet the marble feel good on your bare foot
I'm in the backyard hiding out like I'm Bigfoot
And I won't cater to ya
Yeah I am not Carrabbas, and I ain't taking orders
Here for the loot, and to inspire some of you
To do what you do despite all the fuck you's
'Cause they shit on your shit
Stab you right in the back
'Til you shittin' on the toilet with grammys in your lap

[Ameer Vann:]
Niggas talk a lot of shit
In a safe place
Aiming with they keyboard
They shootin' uppercase
I'm booking tour dates
Money in the suitcase
Commander and the chief like
Barack Hussein
Same nigga, two names
I am onto new things
Flying out of Houston
Lemme say a few things
I don't give a fuck about you or your screen name
I'ma be a star even if I say the same things
'Cause them same things keep me on the wavelengths
I dropped another verse, so you gon' have to pay me
Glock with no safety
Seen niggas on the pavement
Over gang affiliations
Guns with extensions
Seeing niggas get anxious
All these internet gangstas
I'm running outta patience
Nigga, stick to your day shift
And watch what you're saying, and please keep praying
'Cause niggas talk big 'til that price on their head

[Dom McLennon:]
I feel these voices always drown out all the noise in the room
They don't employ you for your purpose
They just need a platoon
Another number in a line ready to march into tombs
I ain't the one to assume
I put the coon in tycoon
We colonizing the moon
I see you look to the sky
And start to wish it was you
Sometimes I wish I was me
Sometimes I'm watching my life
I'm dissociated from what eats my heart up at night
Sleep on a cloud of my strife
I ain't afraid of the heights
They all afraid to appall
I'm just afraid of exciting being a trip to the mall
I need a summer to fall
I need a winter to spring
Got all these seasons within me
Building a story to sing
Don't need a dollar to dream
I need a billion in facts
I need a trillion in wealth
Y'all niggas need to relax
I wanna build up the culture
They wanna dream in the trap
I took the zoom off my lens
And I saw the world in my lap

I'm not tryna be like you
When I grow, money in the bag
Keep the sand in the bag
I'm not tryna be like you
When I grow, money in the bag
Keep the sand in the bag
All my niggas in the bag
I'm not tryna be like you
When I grow, money in the bag
Keep the sand in the bag
All my niggas in the bag
I'm not tryna be like you
When I grow, money in the bag
Keep the sand in the bag
All my niggas in the bag
I'm not tryna be like you
When I grow, money in the bag
Keep the sand in the bag
All my niggas in the bag
I'm not tryna be like you
When I grow, money in the bag
Keep the sand in the bag
All my niggas in the bag
I'm not tryna be like you
When I grow, money in the bag
Keep the sand in the bag
All my niggas in the bag
I'm not tryna be like you
When I grow, money in the bag
Keep the sand in the-
