What are the rules for breakfast today?
What are the words I'm forbidden to say?
I need to let my hair down and grow up like a real ass bitch
A real ass bitch, bitch
What are the rules for breakfast today?

I've been beat up my whole life
I've been shot down, kicked out twice
Ain't no stoppin' me tonight
I'ma get all the things I like

[Merlyn Wood:]
When you see me in the street, they say "Willie, Willie!"
When you don't see me in the street, I'm like a hillbilly
All sad 'cause nobody wanna suck my willy
Not sad, everybody wanna suck my willy
When you see me in the street, they say "Willie, Willie!"
When you don't see me in the street, I'm like a hillbilly
All sad 'cause nobody wanna suck my willy
Not sad, everybody wanna suck my willy

[Dom McLennon:]
They be like "what the fuck is you on?" when we hit the room
Move til' these niggas throw me in the tomb
Hear the sounds of the pharaoh when we spin the tunes
Everything feel right now you in the womb
Wanna motivate you in the afternoon
Top shelf money, that's my new perfume
Twist it up, let it in and inhale the fumes
I'm the one that's zoom if you just assume

[Kevin Abstract:]
I've been beat up my whole life
I've been shot down, kicked out twice
Ain't no stoppin' me tonight
I'ma get all the things I like
I've been beat up my whole life
I've been shot down, kicked out twice
Ain't no stoppin' me tonight
I'ma get all the things I like
