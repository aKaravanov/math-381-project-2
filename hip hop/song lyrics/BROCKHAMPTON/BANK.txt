Still the only one I do that with
Still the only one I do that with
Ain't that some shit

Ain't that some shit

See I've been trippin' and fallin'
No more slippin' and stallin'
Got no numbers I'm callin, just wanna be in the coffin
All this trouble we've been causin'
Benz I'm crossing, I've been saucin'
Exercising my endorphins since you told me you was walkin'
I've been searchin, huntin, crawlin
Whats it costin' me it ain't doing much, tossin' me through a loop
I hush the voices in my head for a minute so I can listen to you
And all I ever heard was "I ain't listenin", shit is cripplin'

[Kevin Abstract:]
Still the only one I do that with
Still the only one I do that with
Ain't that some shit
Still the only one I do that with
Still the only one I do that with
Ain't that some shit

Niggas on that word of mouth, 'til they see them boys come out
I ain't ever robbed a nigga, best believe I air ya out
See me in your area, y'all niggas hilarious
I'm addicted to writing shit that make niggas scared of us
Niggas on that word of mouth, 'til they see them boys come out
I ain't ever robbed a nigga, best believe I air ya out
See me in your area, y'all niggas hilarious

I got rubbers in my pocket, niggas like to gossip
If I need to drop em let me know
'Cos I don't do much talkin', unless it's 'bout the money
If you got an offer let me know
I was sellin cabbage, until I moved to Cali
Money in a mattress on the floor
Until I messed with niggas, with fingers on the trigger
We was runnin' kickin' in the doors

I use protection, my nigga, so fuck direction, my nigga
And fuck yo' section, my nigga, I got the rest of my niggas
My niggas rushed on my niggas, my niggas love all they niggas
I fell in love with a nigga, that nigga skipped out the picture
