This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy
Somewhere out there they will say
He is mine, he is mine

I hope I'm no random guy
Somewhere out there they will say
He is mine, he is mine

Better not, better not, better not
Get too dark please
You should call, you should call, you should call
On me to eat
Even when, even when, even when
Night skies bug me

In the daylight, I could say out loud
What happened to my niggas that I had to pray for
Hands in the dirt, break a little more
Turn around and let the wrong house lead a war
In the daylight, I could say out loud
What happened to my niggas that I had to pray for
Hands in the dirt, break a little more
Turn around and let the wrong house lead a war
In the daylight, I could say out loud
What happened to my niggas that I had to pray for
Hands in the dirt, break a little more
Turn around and let the wrong house lead a war
In the daylight, I could say out loud
What happened to my niggas that I had to pray for
Hands in the dirt, break a little more
Turn around and let the wrong house lead a war

This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy
Somewhere out there they will say
He is mine, he is mine
This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy
