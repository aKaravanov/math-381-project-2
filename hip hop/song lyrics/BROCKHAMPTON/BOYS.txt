[Ameer Vann & Merlyn Wood:]
I feel just like Zayn, I feel just like Harry
I cop it and I flip it, have it sittin' on pirellis
Me and all my niggas, Southside One Direction
Tens and tens and tens and tens, got lens that make direction
Flow to my location, lowkey I'm in Cali just
Avoiding my probation, fuck your jurisdiction
Fuck the Federales, sold out by my father
He gon' feel the karma when I get the- get the commas, nigga
I don't have, I don't have no fear, nigga
Buy the ounce, sellin' ounces over here, nigga
I don't lie, I just bought a whole grill
Arguing with my bitch, my whip sit twenty-six, nigga

[Matt Champion:]
Lowkey I'm a heart-throb and I ain't drop an album yet
I'm something like a poster, sitting on your girl's wall
And something about my face make her take her clothes off
Y'all say y'all got bitches but y'all bitches make my dick soft
Why y'all always mad cause I'm feeling myself
What the fuck you mean, I can't feel myself?
Old girl suburban, but now I'm on to new things
Ego like celebrity, but real like a dope fiend
Tanning out in Hollywood, got Chantel's on my coattails
From motels to hotels, I'm good
Bitch I'm good, from hotels to motels, I'm good
Bitch I'm good, from hotels to motels, I'm good
Bitch I'm good

They say that they want me, they forgot about me
They say that they want me, they forgot about me
They say that they want me, they forgot about me
They say that they want me, they forgot about me

[Dom McLennon:]
In the city I'm a menace, I give CEOs the business
Marathons I gotta finish, foreign whip is speaking Yiddish
Lately I been feeling vicious, why y'all crying like some infants?
You don't wanna be a witness then you better mind your fucking business
All these crumbs on my denim, we the only dogs spitting venom
Been some years I tried to tell them, but they wanted me to be the villain
They just wanted me to lose, ones I love made me choose
Had to cut the ones I thought I'd take to the top, just so I could make a move
Dropped out of college, smoking the same campus tell me 'bout limits
Last year I was suicidal, took those thoughts and tried to kill it
Used to avoid, used to being paranoid, huffin' with my boys
Pack it up, I shake the world like asteroids, give me love before you try to give me noise
I destroy
