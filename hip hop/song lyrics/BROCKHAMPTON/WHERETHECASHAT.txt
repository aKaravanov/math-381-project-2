Pull up to your house and dump like a trash man
All up in your grill, but I'm not a fan
Merlyn, I do no hat-trick, just show me where the cash at
That's you in the hotshots
fuck that, show me where the cash at

I would rather be on acid, rather make investments
Come out of that debt, we'll come out of Benjis
I'm like the IRS, pull up to your address
I was trying to bless a seizure, but pull it like Ke$ha
Jonny Dang gon' ice my diamonds, up out that freezer
I used to be broke, I don't got amnesia
I used to deal with both, now it's black victims
She know not to call collect if she go to prison

Move to your window and drizzle with that pitter-pat
[?], where you niggas at?
Where the cash at? Used to ask that
Where the cash at? Used to ask that
Move to your window and drizzle with that pitter-pat
[?], where you niggas at?
Where the cash at? Used to ask that
Where the cash at? Used to ask that

At night I bring them out
I was sleeping upside-down
Keep you up, I come around
They stay right up on my tip
Send me a pic whenever you slip
Hoping this outflow my scales
Pull that out whenever I bliss
Fifty mil, put it under my wheel
Human, I see through your eyes
Until my CCC wide open to my skin
They can see the run
They feel like they been kicking DDR
Bustin' out the bar, human out the tour
Think we big sized to the gas
Miss the days I can't get back

Move to your window and drizzle with that pitter-pat
[?], where you niggas at?
Where the cash at? Used to ask that
Where the cash at? Used to ask that
Move to your window and drizzle with that pitter-pat
[?], where you niggas at?
Where the cash at? Used to ask that
Where the cash at? Used to ask that
