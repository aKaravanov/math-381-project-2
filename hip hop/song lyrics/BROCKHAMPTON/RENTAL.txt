I need it all downtown, nigga
Put it back where you fuckin' found it though
I need it all down (no, no, no)
Keep 'em right there, oh you found 'em though
I want a shirt that make my body feel all sexy
I want a chain that make my body feel all hefty
I want my head to fall off when I walk out the door
I want the rain to fall down and I'm askin' for more

Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head

[Dom McLennon:]
I wanna love that make me feel like I ain't breakin' ya heart
I wanna know what made you stay when it was wrong from the start
I need to know where you went lookin' where you went through the chop
I need this fear of being with everybody else to depart
I got a lot on my mind, not enough hours and shit
Not enough drugs to believe, not enough him and the kid
I'm feeling hundred an hour so I been ignoring this dick
I'm seeing through what I want to recognise who is there

[Matt Champion:]
Throw me in the fire, baby, I'll survive
Come and tap down by the seaside
Aye, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Aye, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
See the road sign on the 45
Only on me by the borderline
Aye, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Aye, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let it go

[Matt Champion:]
You always sell your own for everything you own
I know it's not used to
See they could tear me down, take everything I made
I'll still be here next to you

Throw me in the fire, baby, I'll survive
Come and tap down by the seaside
Aye, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Aye, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
See the road sign on the 45
Only on me by the borderline
Aye, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Aye, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
