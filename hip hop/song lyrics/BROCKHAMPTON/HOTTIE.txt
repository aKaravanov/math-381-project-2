Put the bag in the cup, add it up, add it up
Put my friends in the truck, add it up, add it up
If you thinkin' on me now, that's enough, that's enough
If you thinkin' on me now, that's enough, that's enough
Put the bag in the cup, add it up, add it up
Put my friends in the truck, add it up, add it up
If you thinkin' on me now, that's enough, that's enough
If you thinkin' on me now, that's enough, that's enough

[Dom McLennon:]
They say "what you contribute to my consciousness?"
Voices feelin' so ominous
I can't place a pen for you, they mark it out as anonymous
I would shift the whole continent if it helped you round with some confidence
Thinkin' bout all the consequence
Gotta try to break, what's monotonous

[Joba:]
How could I be better?
I paid the price in full, just to clear the record
Rewound just to fast forward
On the A track, I stole from my grandmama

[Merlyn Wood:]
Catastrophic, where the stoppin'?
Man, I wish I had a rocket
Wish I ain't feel microscopic
Wish my thoughts was telepathic 
But instead I'm always bad, man
No rappin', that is my girlfriend
Every toe is like a cabbage
Just kidding, I love you assholes

Put the bag in the cup, add it up, add it up
Put my friends in the truck, add it up, add it up
If you thinkin' on me now, that's a enough, that's a enough
If you thinkin' on me now that's a enough, that's a enough
Put the bag in the cup, add it up, add it up
Put my friends in the truck, add it up, add it up
If you thinkin' on me now, that's enough, that's enough
If you thinkin' on me now, that's enough, that's enough

[Joba {Matt Champion}:]
It's hard to air out in deep water
You keep calling, I ignore it
Cleared my conscience in absurd ways
I do the things you hate, I'm changing every day
(I just wanna know, know) {I just wanna know where the party at}
(I just wanna know, know) {24/7 thinkin' 'bout you}
(I just wanna know, know) {I just wanna know when we leavin', boo?}
(I just wanna know, know) {24/7 thinkin' 'bout you}
(I just wanna know, know) {I just wanna know where the party at}
(I just wanna know, know) {24/7 thinkin' 'bout you}
(I just wanna know, know) {I just wanna know when we leavin', boo?}
(I just wanna know, know) {24/7 thinkin' 'bout you}
