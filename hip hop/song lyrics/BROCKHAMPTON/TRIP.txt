Today I'mma be whoever I wanna be
Today I'mma be whoever I wanna be
It's a boy fantasy
It's a girl fantasy
This is our fantasy
Baby boy, boy, boy
Today I'mma be whoever I wanna be
Today I'mma be whoever I wanna be
It's a boy fantasy
It's a girl fantasy
This is our fantasy
Baby boy, boy, boy

Flap, flap, flap your wings
Go high, go high, go high
Ride, ride, ride, ride, rider on the night
This little town, I wanna say goodbye
To everybody here 'cause they're all the same
I hate this place
And everybody here is all the same
Life's a disgrace

Today I'mma be whoever I wanna be
Today I'mma be whoever I wanna be
It's a boy fantasy
It's a girl fantasy
This is our fantasy
Baby boy, boy, boy
Today I'mma be whoever I wanna be
Today I'mma be whoever I wanna be
It's a boy fantasy
It's a girl fantasy
This is our fantasy
Baby boy, boy, boy

[Ameer Vaan:]
Flying on my rocket ship
I'm on an acid trip
I need another pill
Snort and let it drip
I'm with my white friends
We're getting wasted
Trapped in the suburbs
We suffocatin'
We get all our drug and medication
You came with black folks
Hoe, your parents racist
You say they hate me
Well, I love them
We still roll up, we still best friends

[Dom McLennon:]
Everybody smilin'
I don't see what's funny
Everybody friends
Guess I wasn't lucky
Family full of athletes
I was kind of chubby
Shit was never sunny
Wrists were sorta bloody
Lick my wounds with honey
Save me for the vultures
I'm fallin' in the void
I don't know what I discovered
I know I could hear the thunder
I can feel the hunters
They be preying on my hunger
I won't let 'em make me suffer 'cause

[Kevin Abstract:]
Today I'mma be whoever I wanna be
Today I'mma be whoever I wanna be
It's a boy fantasy
It's a girl fantasy
This is our fantasy
Baby boy, boy, boy
Today I'mma be whoever I wanna be
Today I'mma be whoever I wanna be
It's a boy fantasy
It's a girl fantasy
This is our fantasy
Baby boy, boy, boy

[Joba:]
Ooo, take a moment
Do you take a moment?
Do you take a moment?
Ooo, take a moment
Do you take a moment?
Do you take a moment?
