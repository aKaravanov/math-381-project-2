Perfectly fine, it's fine

[Dom McLennon:]
Said nigga brother, nigga brother, whattcha livin' for?
Is you gon' finish what you started? Whatcha quittin' for?
They told me God gave me a mission
But I'm missing the supplies to complete it
I ain't the one you should read in, I'm used to being defeated
So nigga brother, who you schemin' with?
I'm independent 'cause these parties never planned for this
Brotha nigga with the brain, unintentionally swerving in every lane
The feeling's never the same, you chase what you couldn't gain
I'm so accustomed to flames, I couldn't tell you what's fire
Situation is dire, hear them calls from the choir
The disposition acquired from my position on Earth
It's telling me decapitate everything for what it's worth
When I die, these words gon' need separate caskets and a hearse
I don't rhyme, I freeze time and let these hands just do the work
I'm in tandem with my curse, going with maniac since my birth
See the kid that says, "I'm playing and I'm commanding with my nerves"

[Kevin Abstract:]
Tell 'em boys, don't run from us
I been down too long, cousin
I been down too long, brother
Tell the world, I ain't scared of nothin'
Tell the world, I ain't scared of jumpin'
Tell my boy, I want a crib in London
Tell the world to stop trippin' out
I'll build a different houses for different functions
Tell 'em boys, don't run from us
I been down too long, cousin
I been down too long, brother
Tell the world, I ain't scared of nothin'
Tell the world, I ain't scared of jumpin'
Tell my boy, I want a crib in London
Tell the world to stop trippin' out
I'll build a different houses for different functions

[bearface:]
Tryna treat men like baby
Feel the teeth sink in like rabies
Boy, you know you don't look fly
Dem gold chains to ya' neck green, bye

[Matt Champion:]
Nothin' different now, all around now
Who you keep around now? That's a big reflection
Don't like how they talkin' to me, why they walkin' to me?
Wear your shit up on your sleeve, stop projectin' on me
Sense is your surround sound, what's your take on me?
Kill the eagle now, what that make of me?
Angle wide screen, couple sips of Tanqueray
I'ma throw a couple punches, I'ma do it anyway
You know little sinners like they like the Macarena
Lose time, penne style spiced up, jalapeño
Super sonic move through tunnel, two-wheel cycles, slight savage
Got better than 9 millimeter with extended suppressor
Bustin' out the function, highly comfortable
Got this protein on my body made my sweat lethal
Sweet kisses like the candy out the carnival
I'ma call my own shots, hit the audible

[Joba:]
Impending death is the only sign of life
I'm throwing Hail Marys 'til I die
Throw it up, all I have is peace of mind
throwin' up, have my wings clipped
I don't need them shits, learn to fly again
Fast track to last place, I swear I've never been up top
But I'm up here somewhere
Out here, nobody can tell me shit
Shit, never mind what I did back then
You should take a look at yourself instead
Maybe you can find yourself, love yourself
Here's to health and here's to wealth, all together now

Tell 'em boys, don't run from us

[Merlyn Wood:]
HOO! Voodoo Man
Momma took me to the church and I sang a hymn
Co-Colonized Christian
Now I'm losing my religion, yeah
God damn, so narcissistic in this millennium
Fuck you and the bubble that you livin' in
I don't go to church, but I'm so spiritual
Pulled my life out of dirt, that's a miracle
If Jesus was a pop star, would he break the bank?
All these diamonds in my face, I'm shining like a date
I'm living in my prime, man, what can I say?
If the service is an hour, I'm an hour late
