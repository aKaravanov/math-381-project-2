[Merlyn Wood:]
You fired, you fired (For Joie!)
Shorty shot, shorty shorty shot, shorty shorty shot- (x8)
Shorty shot me out the atmosphere, well this one year
I was flying high in the pimp plane atmosphere
Shorty shot, shorty shorty shot, shorty shorty shot- (x8)
Shorty shot me out the sky, well this one year
I was flying high in the pimp plane atmosphere

[Chorus:]
If she could, she could see my final form
I could see you Majin Buu-in' on my Dragon Balls
What you need a map and backpack just to find the one?
Dora, Dora come home, you been searchin' too long

[Rodney Tenor:]
Shit
High-waist jeans with a kid
Shorty always flexin' on the 'gram
Tight, tight jeans with a rack make me go on a rant
Shorty, but your attitude rank
Drunk at the club with your girls only here for the drinks
Untouchable data, unmeasurable playa'
God, the moderator, I ain't sayin' I'm hittin'
I'm was just wondering if I could call at your number
If I was ever in trouble, if I could take you home
I ain't a doper, you ain't a smoker
I'm hopin' to get to know you, I wonder if I could get you gone, girl
I was lookin' for ride-or-dies
And there you came through with your false disguise
I ain't fuckin' around no more
Don't hear me, all she hear was sha-la-la-la

[Chorus:]
If she could, she could see my final form
I could see you Majin Buu-in' on my Dragon Balls
What you need a map and backpack just to find the one?
Dora, Dora come home, you been searchin' too long

[Merlyn Wood:]
We all gonna die one day, man ain't that crazy?
She said thats an odd way convince me to be your lady
That be why you bae, but you is not my baby
I met these three black girls: Ocian, Jurnee, and Mercedes
One's a queen, one's narcoleptic, and one is crazy
Pickin' one lover's just like pickin' one daisy
I need at least a dozen in my DM's on the daily
Why get your nose stuck in one when you can sniff the bouquet?
