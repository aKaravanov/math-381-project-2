Rollin' in my truck, gotta keep it tucked
Because whitey wanna fuck with some niggas like us
Confederate flag, neighbors call me "fag"
Gotta keep it low, I keep that thang up in my bag

[Merlyn Wood:]
Whose society is this?
Who delayed my first kiss?
Who command my scholarship?
And kick us out our neighborhood?
Play our music, make them rich
Play our music, make amends
Box us in like plantains
Free all of my Africans
Nigga, I slay, nigga I waste them, them, waste them

[Kevin Abstract:]
There go that danger boy, danger boy!
There go that danger boy, danger boy!

[Ameer Vann:]
Niggas kill you for a dollar
Listen to 'em holler
Big blood ballers, with a crown on my corner
Crack and marijuana, slab around the corner
Sitting low elbows, syrup on the dashboard

Get money, big bands, simple bands
Big money, big bands, simple bands
Get money, big bands, simple bands
Big money, big bands, simple bands
Get money, big bands, simple bands
Big money, big bands, simple bands
Get money, big bands, simple bands
Big money, big bands, simple bands

[Dom McLennon:]
I got a dream I'm willing to die for
I got a team I'll commit a crime for
Got some dead homies I ain't get to cry for
'Cause I'm working for my freedom, while the world cry war
Cry wolf when the shepherd finds a way to strike gold
'Cause the stocks gon' crash and the dollar gon' fold
You don't know that the poor eat the rich when there's no profit
They gave you the floor but you brought up the wrong topic
So it's

[Joba:]
Me against the world
Me against the world
Me against the world
Me against the world
