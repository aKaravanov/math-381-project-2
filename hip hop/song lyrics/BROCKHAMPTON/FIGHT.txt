My male role models drug dealers and thugs
My father learned how to solve problems with guns
And when I grew up I learned what racism was
And what teaching it does
And like my teachers would say
"Little black boys have a place in the world"
Like hanging from trees
Or dead in the street like I seen on TV
All them boys they killed, they looked just like me
Not like Brandon or Chandler, but Malik and Kareem
I was born with a target, and it stuck to my skin
And I learned in social studies I was one of them men
Who were locked in the chains, but not locked in the pen
But I'm bigger than that, I'm the beginning and end

[Dom McLennon:]
I'm the sun and the moon
I'm the light and the dark
I am life in the tomb
I'm the pharaoh and slave
Gentrifying my spirit
It's like a knife in the womb
Refuse to act like a parrot
Or to dance like a monkey
See your stance is apparent
That's why I'm here for the money
Don't care to cater to Mary
I'm fetishizing my spirit
I see your culture's dependent
On what you didn't inherit
Won't let my world be attempted
I'm staying distant

Who gonna be the gunner that I don't trust
Who gonna be the gunner that get they ass whooped
Who gonna be the reason why I get high
Who gonna be the reason why I turn over
Who gonna be the gunner that I don't trust
Who gonna be the gunner that get they ass whooped
Who gonna be the reason why I get high
Who gonna be the reason why I turn over
Who gonna be the gunner that I don't trust
Who gonna be the gunner that get they ass whooped
Who gonna be the reason why I get high
Who gonna be the reason why I turn over
Who gonna be the gunner that I don't trust
Who gonna be the gunner that get they ass whooped

Bum, bum, beat 'em, I would never wanna be 'em
If I catch 'em slipping they gon' have to meet the eagle
Bum, bum, beat 'em, treat these niggas how I see 'em
I don't need you either, send you right back where I seen ya
Bum, bum, beat 'em, I would never wanna be 'em
If I catch 'em slipping they gon' have to meet the eagle
Bum, bum, beat 'em, treat these niggas how I see 'em
I don't need you either, send you right back where I seen ya

In the game
Running things
