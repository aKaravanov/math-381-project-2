Skinny boy, skinny boy
Where your muscles at?
Used to walk to work
Eight hours, take the bus back
Ain't no time to stop
Ain't no time for vacation
Y'all all want my spot
'Cause you know that I am A1
All these pretty girls
They come running to our place so
I could do without
I could move without
I could do myself
I get in a rut
I feel depressed
I bang on my chest
I say fuck 'em all 'til I'm dead

[Merlyn Wood:]
First off fuck Dolce & Gabbana
Racist mothersuckers tryna be my father
Put that on me auntie and me mama
Grab the Ghost then I go right back to Ghana
I came back again
With the platinum
To the continent
I came back again
I came back again
With the platinum
To the continent
I came back again

Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth (watchin' me baby)
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth (watchin' me baby)
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth (watchin' me baby)
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth (watchin' me baby)
[Ryan Beatty:]
Where we'll go is far away
I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here
Right next to my side
Where we'll go is far away
I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here
Right next to my side

[Dom McLennon:]
Got a lot of things to say that I could never finish
Told my mama I'd be back
Just gotta kill another mission
Gimme thirty seconds and I'll make up for the billion
Every verse a heist for all your underlying feelings
Got canaries on the window
Smell like roses on the ceiling
Oh, what a, oh, what a, oh
How appealing
Candy paint revealing all that bullshit you concealing
Fuck what you been hearing
I'm everything they fearing
I'm black and smart and sexy
Universally appealing
Genius what I'm dealing
Something they ain't stealing
They prohibited the potents
Might give you sclerosis
Spaceship doing donuts
It's written I'm the POTUS
I'm focused

[Matt Champion (Kevin Abstract):]
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth (watchin' me baby)
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth (watchin' me baby)
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth (watchin' me baby)
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth (watchin' me baby)
[Ryan Beatty:]
Where we'll go is far away
I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here
Right next to my side
Where we'll go is far away
I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here
Right next to my side

[Ameer Vann:]
Bar baby, spilled syrup on my big wheel
You could call me li'l nigga with the big crib
My lifestyle still the same
Just a face lift
Silly niggas got me running outta patience
My whole life slowly turned into a daydream
I hit the bank with a smile on my face, man
Pretty women always pullin' at my waistband
Used to get arrested
All I get is checks now

[Ryan Beatty:]
Where we'll go is far away
I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here
Right next to my side
Where we'll go is far away
I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here
Right next to my side
Where we'll go is far away
I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here
Right next to my side
Where we'll go is far away
I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here
Right next to my side
