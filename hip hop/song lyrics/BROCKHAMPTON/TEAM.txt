[Bearface:]
Evanie
Did you die to care since you were seventeen?
How's he holding on, Evanie?
Do you cling to him like you would on to me?
But he needs you more than I, Evanie
Did you hide your neck to save him from his sleep?
I know how that feels, Evanie
Every chance you take you make me want to flee
Can't you see?

You should move on
So don't be found
Whenever you want
I'll be your ride
And flee to the night
Shoots to the sky
Take what you see and
You're keeping me less than lost
'Til you find it in yourself

[Kevin Abstract:]
Little old me, I thought my world was progressive
Cause my president was black, twenty-five lighters on the dresser
I had guilt trip on my back and a bulletproof vest
Inside my Uncle John's Toyota was a walking Crayola

[Ameer Vann:]
(Gimme that mic)
I got a hard time, I gotta watch myself
The way I move through a room full of suits
Ain't no, ain't no Constitution, I hate uniforms
I hate handcuffs, I can't stand up

[Kevin Abstract:]
They throw me in the crowd
And tell me boy I lose that smile
But see I got it from my dad and that's the reason why we had

[Ameer Vann:]
I raise my black fist, I got big lips
I'm strong as Samson, they cut my fuckin' locks
I lose my fuckin' strength, fuck

[Dom McLennon:]
I'm running out of sense
My life been feelin' tense
I won't be on the fence
I put my phone on airplane mode cause I'm on autopilot
I need a lot of patience, I need a lot of silence

[Matt Champion:]
I hope this holy water burn me 'cause
I ain't worth this life
I ain't worth the light of day
Let summer light the way
Nude along the banister
Kitchen smell of lavender
Swimming in my wranglers
I am another caliber

[Bearface:]
Ooh, yeah
[?]
No, no, no, no, no, no
