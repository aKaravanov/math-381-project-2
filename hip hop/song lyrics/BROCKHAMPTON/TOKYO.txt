[JOBA:]
Too many things I'd rather do different
Woke up in a cold sweat
My emotions creepin'
Three o'clock on the weekend
Might as well sleep in
Stay down for the count when
She hit me with the what-ifs and the what-whens and the what-thens
Wonder where my life went
Living in the moment
I been thinking 'bout my time spent
Are the bills paid?
Is it make or break?
Will I find a way?
Are my feelings changed?
Will I be okay?
I'll never know
But what I do know is
Life don't make sense
If you can't pay rent
So I place my bet

[Kevin Abstract:]
What got you shook on this Saturday?
I take my L and I hold my place
I split my L and I go away
You left a spell on my Saturday
What got you shook on this Saturday?
I take my L and I hold my place
I split my L and I go away
You left a spell on my Saturday

[Ameer Vann:]
I got cracks in my phone screen
The past fuck with my psyche
Smoke weed and get high, please
Went to school in the woodlands
And that made niggas wanna fight me
So I don't take threats lightly
Tell them niggas come and find me
Got his head in my eye view
New house off iTunes
New money, my perfume
Big smile, in a good mood
I been running outta issues
I ain't trippin' when the rent due
I ain't runnin' with a pistol
I ain't locked in the system
Taking care of my kin folk

[Dom McLennon:]
Taking a book out the page of the graves
I'm only human and I make mistakes
Chisel my flows so they can't liberate
Talkin' the time as the pendulum sways
I gotta face what I didn't create
Just cause I can't relate
I don't debate
I educate
Illuminate or we can't duplicate
No more moving the plates
Second chances feeling overrated, unappreciated
So I bossed up
Missed the time when we could share space
But it'll all be straight the day we cross up
Nothing better than some time with you because
It's time I never wanna toss up
Lose myself inside of you
You find yourself in me
I don't wanna be cautious

[Kevin Abstract:]
What got you shook on this Saturday?
I take my L and I hold my place
I split my L and I go away
You left a spell on my Saturday
What got you shook on this Saturday?
I take my L and I hold my place
I split my L and I go away
You left a spell on my Saturday

What got you shook?
What got you shook?
What got you shook?
What got you shook?
