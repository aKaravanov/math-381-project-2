

In my room
Staring and tripping
Look at the TV its Adult Swim
Dripping the lick from the LSD
Lucid I'm dreaming
On broader perspectives
Chiefing forever
Smoked out with Ciara
Right on 37, the hottest of weathers
November the 4th to November the 6th
On memory lane as my mind reminisce
On my dawgs
Why she'd have to go the wrong way?
Yung Grease all up in this with the fucking gun play
No MMG's is the RIP
And the channel 7 news
Bumping on the Twitter feed
On the story about the beings
Yellow tape at the scene
Lead bullets to your jaw
Martin Luther King
She was only 18 hit got hit with 13
Be Careful where you go
Cuz niggas is lurking
All night, Poltergeist, Ghost
Tell me who I can't approach
Having my dawgs tryna get inside my head
As I wonder how Rodney King might stay afloat
Coast, dead
Gone off the shroom pack
Joints stay fat, like Joe
Have a squad terror at your door
Pour shit, head in the dead zone

I'm in that Void
Tell me who fucking with the boy
Back down 'fore a nigga get destroyed
I'm in that Void
Tell me who fuckin with the boy
Talk shit but you wear corduroys
I'm in that Void
Niggas won't ride by side
Take you out any moment you fried
I'm in that Void
Nigga gotta grab my nine
On a nigga fuck up my vibe
I'm in that Void

Why these motherfucker tryna plot?
Crackers be acting green like that nigga Roger Klotz
When there's no evidence
Cuz blacks irrelevant
Better scrape up the world and to in celibate
Criminal element where revolutionatists
Is a rebel, a-con artist with common sense
Is a nigga based on the skin, not ignorance
Is a bitch, obligated to suck a dick
Maybe not
Carol City Porters stay HOT
Eleven shooters caught up inside a weed head shot
Take photo, ended up in limbo
Oh no
Bringing out the Glock like Frodo
Golem, destroying the land like Sodom
Gomorrah, of eight twenty six
I present you south Florida
What I see, clear as Visine
My brother ended up in a crime scene
Cops are the only ones on a crime spree
Carol suck my brother untimely
Tryna get a little face so niggas try me
So I’m coming at their scalp like apache
Indians in the biz down the 32 ave
God damn nigga causing after math
What the fuck you know
I build, destroy
Motherfuckers can’t feel that

I'm in that Void
Tell me who fucking with the Void
Back down before a nigga gets destroyed
I'm in that Void
Tell me who fuckin with the boy
Talk shit but you wear corduroys
I'm in that Void
Niggas won't ride by side
Take you out any moment you fried
I'm in that Void
Nigga gotta grab my nine
On a nigga fuck up my vibe
I'm in that Void

Is it time to be towing
I got the slide shit we throning
I got the time and I'm toking
Good guys be lying and I'm slowing
This ain't no joking
Oh oh oh
People text me fore they know just who you are
There's no time to waste I'm tryna make it fly
Heard this place a cloud
Bitch we making them sounds
Search the fiends from down
