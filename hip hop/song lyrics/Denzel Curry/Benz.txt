Looking like LisaRaye
My bitch is in the passenger
Like dracula and Carmen Hayes
Who blow me like cocaine
With a little propane
King of the Hill
I keep it real
She drop that top like Rogaine
So slide wit ya boy
If you ain't talkin bout Benz
Then I don't wanna ride with ya boy
Come over here get high with ya boy
Glide with ya boy
Side with ya boy
I do it how I wanna do it
Run that pussy Carl Lewis
Now she thinking she my wife
Oh my god, are you stupid
Talkin about all I need is love and affection
But baby I'm a...
And I am not the type to mess with
I'm cruisin in that Lexus
With a chick named Alexis
And later in the night
She gone earn herself
A pearl necklace

[Hook:]
I'm that, I'm that, nigga so
Fall back, fall back
And you don’t really
Want that, want that
Cause you ain’t really
On that, on that
I told my baby
[x2]

I'm that nigga countin figures
Bumpin to that 69
Your bitch on that ecstasy
That [?] grind
Drinking off of dollar signs
She all on the dick
And she clappin her thighs
Finesse at expense
With my face on her breasts
And she poppin that pussy
Just like a .45
Now, when I recline
I'm in my zone
Bitch nigga I'm fine
Bruh bruh just vibe
She done with her twerking
Damn she tired
Ride, I told ya chick lets slide
In order to dive in the passenger
A nigga just had to just fuck with her mind
Dick and desire in her temple
Now she thoughts are caught in her mental
Now she wants to ride my beep
Like singers ride instrumentals
But I bump that little key
And she told that girl to bust it
Man she do it like a stripper
When she lay it down and then touch it
So rub it, similar to vapor rub
For your chest, make those panties
Tsunami, mixed with false Viagra wet
Now it's a family reunion
When my mini-me is down her neck
Raven Miyagi, a curious killer
That nigga that never take kindly to threats
