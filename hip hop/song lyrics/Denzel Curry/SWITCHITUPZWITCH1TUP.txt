That nigga raw, that nigga green, switch it up
That nigga lost, he in the lead, switch it up
I'ma get money by any means, run it up

Uh huh, to be, or not to be?
Havin' 'em lit, if it ain't homicide I don't commit
Y'all throw a fit when you don't got a fit
If you put out a hit, bet you the killer ain't gon' make a cent
Bitch, it's a Miami nigga no Moonlight
Let's take it back to the crib
One of my homies, he pull the gun on me
He turnin' cold on me like meet the maker
So super phony as if he don't know me
I see what they told me about the hater
And I wasn't even phased, been the hottest in the place
Talkin' 'bout a nigga changed with a pocket full of change
Range, this order, blame this for the pain in Florida
Bipolar, vibe over, time slower I'm sober, now I sorta see
What is going on with me? Gotta shout-out homie G
You did wrong, but it's done for the right, new friends, new flies
They swarm to the light, money and a new girl
That's warm for the night
Do a hoe like clothes they worn for the night like

That nigga nice, that nigga mean, switch it up
That nigga raw, that nigga green, switch it up
That nigga lost, he in the lead, switch it up
I'ma get money by any means, run it up

Uh huh, how can I see through my lenses
When I can't see who my friend is, huh?
Wanna be down as dependent, would you give up your appendix?
If life is hangin' by a thread, then a nigga just might be dead
If my life was in your hands, now a nigga don't trust no man
Maybe I shoulda been shot on the day that it happened
When you started snappin' on me
They only seen what's on the one side
It's deeper than rap nigga and a nigga move back to the 3
Get back to it with the boys in my hood 'cause it ain't no [?] no other
I got new niggas tellin' these new niggas that I don't fuck with my brother
They only know Denzel Curry, but they really don't know Denzel
Everybody wanna ride waves and jump when the ship don't sail
You did wrong, not done for the right
New friends, new flies, you flew to the life
Funny what these new niggas might do for the hype
Lesson learned, I'm goin' on through with ya life like

That nigga nice, that nigga mean, switch it up
That nigga raw, that nigga green, switch it up
That nigga lost, he in the lead, switch it up
I'ma get money by any means, run it up
That nigga nice, that nigga mean, switch it up
That nigga raw, that nigga green, switch it up
That nigga lost, he in the lead, switch it up
I'ma get money by any means, run it up
