[Denzel Curry:]
Ultimate

Equalizer, synthesizer
Ultimately, I will brutalize ya
I got the shit that could take out New York
I do not fuck with the population
Contemplation killing competition
Confrontation, reevaluation
You don't want to see the revelation
Straps looking like a lederhosen
Stop

Doctor said he couldn't hold on
Cut, motherfucker I am Logan
N-I-G-G-A Attila The Hun
Mixed with Bishop Magic Juan
I got the fuckin' magic wand
I am the ugly, I am so ugly
With the face, only ya mother could love me
Nothing is lovely, only get loneliness
Phoniness, only resides on the tongue
Sun is never radiant, coming undone
So instantaneous, it is begun
No way escaping it though
Suicide thoughts with the murder I wrote
Death from anonymous, broken my promises
Feeling that I will return later on
Fuck it, it's Halo, I wouldn't respawn

Equalizer, synthesizer
Ultimately, I will brutalize ya
I got the shit that could take out New York
I do not fuck with the population
Contemplation killing competition
Confrontation, reevaluation
You don't want to see the revelation
Straps looking like a lederhosen
Stop

I make them bands in the day, yuh
I hit a lick, it not real
Check my account and I double up
I make them bands in the day
