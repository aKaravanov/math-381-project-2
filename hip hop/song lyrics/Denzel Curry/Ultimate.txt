I am the one, don't weigh a ton
Don't need a gun to get respect upon the street
Under the sun, the bastard son
Will pop the Glock to feed himself and family
By any means, your enemies my enemies
We wet them up like a canteen
The yellow tape surrounds the fate
Don't have a face so now you late, open the gates

Great, eliminate like ElimiDate
Hey, young boy had to penetrate
Face, young boy done caught a case
Bang, now his mama living with the pain
Wait, doctor says he's gonna stay
Let him get the senzu bean so he regenerate
Now a nigga harder than the head of the state
Denzel Curry is the new candidate
Ultimate, alternate, you are the opposite
Stop this shit, chop your esophagus
Bitches be bopping it, bow down and popping it
Dropping it in her esophagus
She get so nasty, in public she classy
Perhaps she is able to swallow it
Girl, I can make you a star
Then I put her ass on Apollo, bitch
Bitch, I am ultimate, behold my awesomeness
Narcissist, part time an arsonist
Ripping through cartilage, I am the hardest, bitch
Wrap it up, put in sarcophagus
Dearly departed, it's done when it started
So now that I'm living so harmonious
Feeling like Spartacus, Curry the ultimate
I am the best, there's no politics, bitch, I'm ultimate, ultimate, bitch.

I am the one, don't weigh a ton
Don't need a gun to get respect upon the street
Under the sun, the bastard son
Will pop the Glock to feed himself and family
By any means, your enemies my enemies
We wet them up like a canteen
The yellow tape surrounds the fate
Don't have a face so now you late, open the gates

Ultimate, infinite, flow is opium
Open the Internet, photosynthesis
Put up parentheses, temporary
Very scary if I feel like Dirty Harry
Just might bust a bitch
Never knew my life, but yet the question is
Is he fake, is he real, what the message is
Chop a bitch nigga up, I'mma sever it
When I sever shit
I kill 'em, no Kony, these niggas ain't homies
Claim you the homie, I turn into Broly
Dropping melodic, enter the cosmic
Flow like a prophet, lyrical toxic
Flow like a foreigner, I'm the torturer
Out of South Florida, call the coroner
Killed in the corridor, I'm the overlord
Rhymes like a sorcerer, I'm an animorph
Bitch, I'm a beast
Nigga, you tell me who fucking with me
K to the I to the N to the G
Claim you the hottest, but I disagree
Better learn something and get a degree
This for Lord Infamous so R.I.P.
Arrivederci, bitches looking thirsty, riding through the dirty
Like it's mandatory, ending of the story

I am the one, don't weigh a ton
Don't need a gun to get respect upon the street
Under the sun, the bastard son
Will pop the Glock to feed himself and family
By any means, your enemies my enemies
We wet them up like a canteen
The yellow tape surrounds the fate
Don't have a face so now you late, open the gates
