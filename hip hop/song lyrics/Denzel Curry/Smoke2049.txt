Back in my lungs [x7]

Still pouring liquor for my niggas
That's that’s (Chinaman) and Tiara
Moments play back in my mental about the last night of terror
Am I scared of dying, more of a bullet flying
Enter my window and [?]
I hear niggas knocking at the door
Talking about some coochie shit like cascade
This shit is war round these parts
Is on your porch even at the park
Shooting your bloods and your [?] out the dark
Then they jump out and [?]
13 round from the sound of the chopper
Guaranteed dropper
Go on and let the hammer bang
Like Bob the builder they fix it and rang
AK-47, 30 second to 47, fill it up with mac-11s
Eating church's chicken reverend
Z-3 C-4 River City lake Lucerne Scott lake Rolling Oats [?]
Murder grove what it be and its still free [?]
Let's go get em [x4]

Ready to get that smoke, ready to get that smoke
Back in my lungs [x7]
