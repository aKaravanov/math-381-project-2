[Billie Eilish & Denzel Curry:]
Babe, when you hear the siren sounds
When the karma come back 'round, don't let me down
Babe, there's a time to stand your ground
Even if one of them sounds, don’t let me down

[Denzel Curry:]
Eyesight is a gateway to a new day and the same hate
With a new height and the same feet on a airplane yellin’ "Mayday"
With a good girl gone bad girl who ain't gay cause her date rape
That's a metaphor for the US 'cause they got us all in the same state
State of mind, brain is minimized, put me on the news, only criticize
Revolution will never be televised
For the enemy, they never empathize
And I never voted, never sugar coat it
With my finger itchin' and my gun loaded
When the fire open, let it be your moment
When I shoot the sheriff if he not demoted, then bang!
This for Trayvon and Tree, burn the bush and chronic
Speakin' honestly, we livin' in colonies, CNN sit-comedies
Monstrosity run rampant all throughout United States
Talkin' about let’s make a fort, talkin’ about let's make it great
If the shoes fit, tie it, grab the guns and riot
Time to run with lions on the road to Zion
In this age of violence, time to grab the iron
When I pop the silencer, it’s nothing but silence when-

[J.I.D:]
Uh, look, okay
Ba-aby, I'm a fool because I thought you would stay whether I win or I lose
They already think we dead
But they continue to shoot, I'm just gon' cover my head
I need to duck and I move, I bust a move when I-
Find a way to get on and get up, get out the crib
I was just looking into the mirror, tryna dislocate my fear
'Cause you broke my heart, let me dry my tears
So serious, I'm so neglected
In the wrong direction with a long erection, got no protection
But it's, "fuck the world"
When she bend it over, being over-sensitive
But did I mention what my real intentions are?
Really dealin' with the consequences
And I see your tone is very condescending
When I talk to you, but no you won't admit it
And I pity the fool, been tryna to vent, but you ain't tryna hear it
Like I'm not in here, but you gotta hear it
Just how much you mean off to the side (oh, shit)
Oh say can you see a hundred dead bodies in the street
Bite the dust early like double Sprite, and a R.I.P. tee
So proudly, lights gleam, let the gun blow in the night time
Of the slum house, little drum bump of the 1,000
(come, come here they come)

[Denzel Curry:]
Birds chirpin', dogs barkin', kids missin', milk cartons
Soul dark as black markets, war is startin', more is sparkin'
Historic prophets praise Muhammad
Diff'rent Strokes, Philip Drummond
Gave me crack, like I'm plumbin', Jesus Christ, second comin'
Cut myself, now I'm numbin', never scared, never runnin'
Chosen one, I'm one hunnid, pray for me, pray for London
Guilty me, he ain't done and gun me down, all for nothin'
President in abundance, president is a puppet
Gotta hate it, gotta love it, Pass a class, I rise above it
Wise enough, advise the public, pistol bust, screamin' "fuck it"
Donald Trump, Donald Duck, what the fuck is the difference?
Now we stuck, in a rut, this ain't what I envisioned
What is what? What is guts when you don't have intuition?
Not a saint, not a sin, tell me what's my real religion?
Genocide, Genesis, they say it's a new beginnin'
I'm a sinner, you a sinner, I can see the devil grinnin', damn
