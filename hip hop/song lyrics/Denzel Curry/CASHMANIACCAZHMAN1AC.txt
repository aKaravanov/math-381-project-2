[Nyyjerya:]
Moving up like escalators
I can't see the floor, stacking money, fuck a hater
Free bands cash flow
Bread so long, bouta buy the whole mall

[Denzel Curry:]
In my Wonderland, I'm back on my Alice
Back in my palace, I'm fly like Aladdin
Serving my fans all my dope, cause they addicts
Haters mad cause I'm on top like an attic
And if it's beef then we're shooting sporadic
Game is like Disney, my words are like magic
I like Black Beatles, but act like Black Sabbath
I smoke the O-Z when shit gets erratic

You see my future, but you cannot have it
I see my Future, but I'm not B-Rabbit
Balance my chi so I could tame the savage
Getting so throwed 'til my thoughts are in fragments

[Nyyjerya:]
Moving up like escalators
I can't see the floor, stacking money, fuck a hater
Free bands cash flow
Bread so long, bouta buy the whole mall
Moving up like escalators
I can't see the floor, stacking money, fuck a hater
Free bands cash flow
Bread so long, bouta buy the whole mall

[Denzel Curry:]
Life is so golden that's how I'm living
Look at my trunk jumping out like it ribbit
Devil gon' hate, blurring my vision
That's me at my lowest, no Peter Griffin
Young, black and gifted, I'm bout to get lifted
Now all my troubles and problems have shifted
After my fifth hit it seems I'll be drifting
I'm never slipping, I'm forever pimping

You see my future, but you cannot have it
I see my Future, but I'm not B-Rabbit
Balance my chi now, I'm feeling fantastic
Getting so throwed 'til my thoughts are in fragments

[Nyyjerya:]
Moving up like escalators
I can't see the floor, stacking money, fuck a hater
Free bands cash flow
Bread so long, bouta buy the whole mall
Moving up like escalators
I can't see the floor, stacking money, fuck a hater
Free bands cash flow
Bread so long, bouta buy the whole mall

Cash maniac, cash maniac, cash maniac
Babe, I'm on a roll
Cause I like to run it
Summer doesn't linger
Babe, I'm on a roll
Cause I like to run it
Summer doesn't linger
Ooh
