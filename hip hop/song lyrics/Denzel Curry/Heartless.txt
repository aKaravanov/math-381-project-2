Bap Bap Blap Blap Blap Blap

My gun got diarrhea when it
Boop boop boop boop boop
Y'all niggas with that barking shit
That woo woo woo woo woo
Do you hear the 1 to 44, double 22
Hold on let me slow it down, R.I.P. DJ Screw
Niggas be thinking they real niggas
Niggas be thinking they shining
Niggas be thinking they diamonds
My niggas movin' in silence
You niggas don't want a war
I lay you down with the dinosaurs
Bitch I am a megazord
In the streets you do not win awards
I'm high as a hoverboard
I don't compute like a motherboard
I eat like a carnivore
None of you niggas prepared for war
This ain't what you heard before
Roll up the green like a herbivore
This ain't what you heard before
Roll up the green like a herbivore
Like Jordan you stay with the bullshit
My nigga I'm done with the nonsense
My nigga I'm outta my conscience
I'm throwin' my brain out the window
A whole bunch of kush and some indo
I'm bout to roll up with my kinfolk
With all of the things that I seen
It's looking just like what Bush wrote
Roll it up, smoke it up
And put it through the glass pipe
Fuck around with me
This'll probably be your last night
First time she saw me it'll probably be her last time
When she call me back
I'ma tell her it's a bad time

I do not talk shit, I rented a starship
Out of my starship, I slept with a goddess
Out of the darkness, I feel like a goblin
I am so heartless, I'm feeling so heartless
I am so heartless, why am I so heartless?
I am so heartless, why am I so heartless?
I am so heartless, why am I so heartless?
I am so heartless, why am I so heartless?
