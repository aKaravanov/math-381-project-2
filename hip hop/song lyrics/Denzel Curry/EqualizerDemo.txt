Ultimately I will brutalize ya
I got the shit that could take out New York
I do not fuck with the population
Contemplation killing competition
Confrontation, reevaluation
You don't want to see the revelation
Straps looking like I left the o-zone

Stop, doctor said he couldn't hold on
Cut, motherfucker I am Logan
N-I-G-G-A Attila The Hun
Mixed with Bishop Magic Juan
I got the fuckin' magic wand
I am the ugly, I am so ugly
With the face only a mother could love me
Nothing is lovely, only get loneliness
Phoniness, only resides on the tongue
Son, is the [?]
So instantaneous it is begun
No way escaping the dough
Suicide thoughts with the murder I wrote
Tears from anonymous poking my promises
Fiending it I will return later on
Forget this halo I wouldn't respawn

Equalizer, synthesizer
Ultimately I will brutalize ya
I got the shit that could take out New York
I do not fuck with the population
Contemplation killing competition
Confrontation, reevaluation
You don't want to see the revelation
Straps looking like I left the o-zone
Stop
