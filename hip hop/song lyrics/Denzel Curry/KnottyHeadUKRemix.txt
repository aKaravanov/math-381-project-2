[Rick Ross:]
It's history right here
Wassup my nigga?
It's time to empower these niggas mane, do it for the city
We got to give it to them raw though, ya feel me?

[AJ Tracey:]
J-11 skeet skeet, 20 freaks word to Reeks
I put sauce in these streets
Smashing grabs in no deets
Brody Dave had the squares
Rock star with them tears
I was juggin' like I am Rick Ross
Losing weight eating pears
[?] smart water
Richy Rich I'm not Porter
Sending lamb to that slaughter
Slaught it, chopper 9 to that quarter
Niggas talk but I bang (Bow!)
Niggas sell but don't slang
Judge got bacon and damn, oh man
They so nice in that can
Flowers and snakes on my garments
I fuck mothers in appartments
Eating dinner as my starters
Tryna hit the belly no Cartman
Shorty make a nigga cartwheel
I had money for the half deal
Hoe shot me down with a crossbow
Now I don't know how a heart feel
I got uncles and they [?] Phill
If she ain't fucking then she can't chill
Real niggas drip up the trackies
That's a savage you can ask Dill
I used to [?] back on an outfit casual
Now it's [?] when I step out
[?]

[Denzel Curry:]
U.L.T for life and I'm gon' rep till the death of me
My physical and spiritual is never sold separately
Mediclinic incline forever feeling that the sky is better
Sky is not the limit my attitude will disguise the weather
Under my sweater I'm feeling as if I'm under pressure
I need a Smith and Wesson
You say I need a lecture
I got a dead brother plus I've never seen my mother
Question my feelings of her
Asking me if I still love her

Get the product then we out the door
Mama I've been twistin' weed
And now it's time to lock the fro, blowin' dro
Call me knotty head cause I don't give a fuck
I was raised off in the projects, know this life ain't meant for us
Bitch I can't be touched
Get the product then we out the door
Mama I've been twistin' weed
And now it's time to lock the fro, let it go
Call me knotty head and if I ever go
Tell my mama that I love her cause tomorrow not for sure
I would never know

Tote a 4 and pour some liq'
I'm a tote that stick until they send me to the pen
This the way it is, I gotta get it how I live
Knotty headed niggas
Told her I might hit a lick
I'm a tote that stick until they send me to the pen
This the way it is, I gotta get it how I live
Knotty headed niggas

[Rick Ross:]
Found another body in the lake
Same day another tattoo on his face
Obituary on his mother's fireplace
Baby mother fuck another sucker on a blind date
Shots fired every night I'm tryna mind mine
Dolphin Gang, Bello cigars on the sideline
Pussy niggas you can see it on his timeline
Hatin' on his dawg, shit I'm tryna find mine
Calm nigga when I'm lit up I get Von Miller
Rich niggas if you real then you can run with us
Educated reading books I'm talkin Art of War
Whippin yoda yayo residue on the marble floors
I wanna see my niggas with the flyest clothes
Came to put my city on that's if I'm right or wrong
Pulling into Risco Park in the richest cars
And I'm thinking of my dawgs since I'm livin wrong
Jehovah's witness swear to God I done seen it all
Picking up the pistols every time the dogs bark
You pointing fingers but them choppers cutting arms off
D.C.C.C. we came to warn y'all
Mothafucka damn right we came to warn y'all
Mothafucka damn right we came to warn y'all
Curry what's up! Double M
It's futuristic shit
