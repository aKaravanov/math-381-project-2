[Denzel Curry:]
How many niggas is hanging and pimping is evident when none of you niggas got pimp in your blood
All of y'all watered down like a tub full of suds
I can not fuck with you let me roll up my bud
Girl you look like a dime but can you roll up a dub
Go to the club you said you ain't looking for love
But you dark and lovely and the night was gusting
Marijuana and bubbly like your body damn luscious
Fucking you without clothes is the only thing I'm seeing
Hair swaying you hear what I'm saying I may be a group but this time I'm not playing
This conversation was start of creation, creating a game that was shown to me
Niggas be praising you hopeless to play with you sorry my dude you're just shone to me

Well it's cool to us if you want to be shown
We'll just blame it on the fact that she just don't know
It's cool cause you are delusional cause you know that we know that you are what you are you're a shone

[Twelve'Len:]
I respect the ladies no love for these hoes
Whats the point in fucking bitches when that shit gets old
Seen it time and time again the way that you don't know
So I had to switch the game up cause fuck bitches get old
Time for me to settle down just another boy chasing after these skirts
All of these hoes only know what I worth
Yeah I got a girl don't want her to get hurt, mane
Bout to go way back home, away from the life full of sin
That Billie Jean and a cup o' gin
I know you wanna fuck don't pretend shawty

Well it's cool to us if you want to be shown
We'll just blame it on the fact that she just don't know
Its cool cause you are delusional cause you know that we know that you are what you are you're a shone

No need to [x6]
