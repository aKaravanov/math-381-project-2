Anti American, I'm pro Assata
I write rhymes like a scholar
All about a dollar, dollar equals Allah
Put away the scouters
You won't see my power, this your final hour
On Nefertiti, this is for the city
Cut throat, you shouldn't fuck with my committee
Kill it, call it Kenny, say it came from Diddy
All you other rappers hella Pooh, no Winnie
Eeny, meeny, miney, moe
Tic-tac-toe, leave a XO on a death note I wrote
Float on a backstroke with my black clothes
I'ma asshole, God knows how to act most
Fear me, team brought it down now they fear me
You want a war bring the gear please
Murdering everyone yearly, sincerely (ultimate)

They wanna scan on my wrist
My whole life been at risk
Make a plan for my jitt shit
Look at the time on my wrist, make a play so legit
On my hate government shit
They wanna scan on my wrist
My whole life been at risk
Make a plan for my jitt shit
Look at the time on my wrist, make a play so legit
On my hate government shit
They wanna scan on my wrist
My whole life been at risk
Make a plan for my jitt shit
Look at the time on my wrist, make a play so legit
On my hate government shit
They wanna scan on my wrist
My whole life been at risk
Make a plan for my jitt shit
Look at the time on my wrist, make a play so legit
On my hate government shit
