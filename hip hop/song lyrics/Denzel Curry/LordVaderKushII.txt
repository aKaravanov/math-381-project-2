[Hook:]
Lord Vader Kush
Staying all black
Niggas wanna be with it in a gang
Roll up on a sucker hit him with the click clack
3-2 Zel
Anakin Skywalker pack
Burn a motherfucker to the ashes
Make sure a pig don't come back
Fuck niggas envy me because I'ma ball
6 man shawty I'ma ball until I fall
Fuck niggas they envy me cause I'ma ball
6 man shawty I'ma ball until I fall
(bitch)

I put them L's in the sky, like a niggas thinking I'm Jésus
Arnold Schwarzenegger any nigga chillin' with her
Black bitch fuck around her might erase you
Flat land bounce that I walk on
Sometimes I never seem to walk home
47th Ave down 17th Ave like Rudy Tabootie you in a Chalk Zone
All Chicago niggas got 30's, Dade County got K's
Carol City nigga from the route,in a stadium, start shit in a 3-2 lane
I can show motherfuckers that feel my pain, Uzumaki upon the terrain
Niggas killing niggas over bitches, but my nigga this ain't the Django Unchained
Shot like Jamie Foxx got the neighborhood watch thinkin' they the fuckin' cops
Shoot a nigga pop, pop, pop
Everybody gets all Innocence [?]
Time to expose all of the god damn half knots
Curry, how does the [?] and the weaponry
Risen from nothing but short hand built legacy
Honestly it would be down to endevour me
[?]
Betcha Rozay ain't never ever heard no shit like this (huh)
New age of the Ice Age, Kent Clark from this Carol city life shit
Betcha Rozay ain't never ever heard no shit like this
New age of the Ice Age, Kent Clark from this Carol city shit

[Hook]

Running getting wicked while I'm bumpin' Biggie
Who is the wickedest infidel you ever saw
Split the blunt in half with a lightsaber staff
Fertilize it with dab whenever you split the god
New age, ice age, I'm a whole boss
Stand out with super models in a room with Chris Bosh
C9 is the future and my gang be bosh
Niggas stop the reality, now we fucking with dignitosh
Cause my point 0, next episode
Give em the chronic that let em' explode
D-O double Jizzle it's a dog eat dog world [?]
Legendary singer, Will Smith
That's the both sides I'm a walking talkin' spliff
On another level nigga I'm a [?] you a chef
Like meet me in the shopping you better get a grip on life
Killa clan destined looking for lotto and astral projection
On the other side with a jesus piece flexin'
Like Reed Richards, Mr Fantastic in my bed and [?] I'm breathin'
Inhale exhale
Looks like I'm calling Jehovah on the Nextel
On the 3-2 Avenue to fuck with Denzel
As the rest of the virus falls false just like hell
I say
Betcha Rozay ain't never ever heard no shit like this (huh)
New age of the Ice Age, Kent Clark from this Carol city life shit
Betcha Rozay ain't never ever heard no shit like this
New age of the Ice Age, Kent Clark from this Carol city shit
