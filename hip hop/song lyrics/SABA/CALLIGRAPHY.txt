I don't write this shit so y'all will feel God comin'
I don't get down like that
Wrote this amount of raps
Just on a mission to find something
Calligraphy
Needed to feel, move to the beat of my drum
I don't mean kick and the snare
We cannot bear all of the fucked up shit that we been through
Why God keeping us here?
We be aware, but only timing will tell, when you will find all your letters
Calligraphy

Write it away, write it away
I just got tired of runnin' away, runnin' away
Everyone leavin', I write 'em away, write 'em away
Calligraphy
Write it away, write it away
I just got tired of runnin' away, runnin' away
Everyone leavin', I write 'em away, write 'em away
Calligraphy

I'm not mad at God, I just can't get out of bed
My best friend obituary really hang on my wall, by the dresser
I'm tryna see it, a life lesson
No more time for mournin' on my schedule
I see the right list
Calligraphy
Readin' the signs like I'm a highway driver
I just hit Blaise Blaise, hieroglyphic
I see the wall that they write in, I build a wall up in my head
Autopilot, what it felt like I was on
I sent the word out flyin'
Calligraphy

Write it away, write it away
I just got tired of runnin' away, runnin' away
Everyone leavin', I write 'em away, write 'em away
Calligraphy
Write it away, write it away
I just got tired of runnin' away, runnin' away
Everyone leavin', I write 'em away, write 'em away
Calligraphy

Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
I can't get out of it, I'm not mad at God
But I can't get out of it
Makes me runnin' away, runnin' away, runnin' away
