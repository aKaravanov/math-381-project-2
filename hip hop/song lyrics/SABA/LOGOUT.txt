Right away, aye

If you press logout, you get forgotten
What's a post, but a reminder just how boring our lives ar-ar-ar-are
Look at how much fun I'm havin'
Ain't' no beauty in the absence, of broadcastin' to your followers
I see her, said let's get naked
I seen her sip-sippin' Henya'
I seen famous people all over
I don't want no autograph, I just want a follow back
Maybe tag to ya' followers

Playback, say that
That just the way that the game go
After the rain is a rainbow
I see a product you pay for, shit get forgotten a day ago
If I can not logon, and they started a rumor that I had got shot like a day ago
I don't wanna put down my headphones
I don't got cable in my crib
I don't even know how we got here
Being independent is my fear
Government look like the mafia, censorin' out what you watchin'
Internet turned me into another man
Solitaire more than game with your card
Can't change the channel, it'll stay in our heart
Stay in the public and pray to your God
Need validation, I'm too insecure
Carry those duffs from 140, 280, you posted your story
I'm from the 2-90, two sides to each story
Yeah I'll be your friend, but you can not follow me

Everybody insecure, especially people with everything
Why else you think they got everything?
How else you think they got ev-Ooh
Everybody insecure, especially people with everything
Why else you think they got everything?
How else you think I got every-Look

[Chance The Rapper:]
Everything's on camera, everything's on camera
Everybody want handouts, everybody got pamphlets
Everybody want Santa, everything is on camera
Everybody want pics now, everybody got antlers
Everybody my kid now, everybody got pampers
Everything is on me now, everybody got cameras
Ain't nobody got Chancellor, ain't nobody got answers
All them scratchin' they head now, ain't nobody got dandruff
Don't nobody likes selfies on they own page
I know people with they friend request as their homepage
Ain't put a picture on they wall since the Stone Age
Feel locked up in they own cage, when they on stage
