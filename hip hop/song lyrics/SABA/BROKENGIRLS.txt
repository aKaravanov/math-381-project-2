I'm in love with broken girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, hey girl

Really I'm broke myself, and I think she might help
Really I love a story, and I think she might tell
Really I'm not your crutch, really you not my girl
Really she usin' me, but it's cool, we use eachoth'
I'm in love with contemplatin' about the pressure
Conversations about depression
Confrontation 'cause we care too much about each other
We know it ain't permanent, but temporary
Releasin' your Issa Rae, insecure
Collect them like Pikachu, Venusaur
We go 'til you done or my penis sore
Sleepin' with the TV on, then we don't speak no more
And I know when I'm with you, or maybe when you're with me
Even if I don't feel a thing, for a second I feel complete
I still will keep ya in my back pocket
I know that I'm not shit, I know that it's toxic
I know that a part lives, that is where your heart is

I'm in love with broken girls, girls, girls, hey girl, girl, girl, girl
I'm in love with broken girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, hey, girl

Tread light like broken glass, really I'm not my past
Really I snatched your soul, really that's not to brag
Really when I'm alone, really I'm not to have
Really I know you're empty but I think I can fill your glass
Fantasizin' all your problems
I wanted you more since I found out you heartless
Harbourin' feelins' for niggas who hurt you
Know you on the surface but not on a personal level
I play the game of hearts, missin' piece, we ain't apart
Depend on me until I'm bored
I return your heart as quick I return your call
Tables turn quicker, 'cause after a weekend I miss ya
I don't want you, but I'm conflicted
I know that back and forth yo-yo shit over with
But you gon' take me back, I'm gon' convince ya
Pain ain't never looked so temptin'
Lonely never looked so distant, we just gon' ignore the tension
You know we both not shit, I know that shit toxic

I'm in love with broken girls, girls, girls, hey girl, girl, girl, girl
I'm in love with broken girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, hey, girl

This whole time been obsessed, being sad
She was my quick escape, made me forget
Hear her speak, see her weak, made me feel big
Crowned me, she downed me, treat me like shit
Second time, round two, what I learn?
She weren't mine, that weren't love, I weren't hers
I'm not hurt anymore, took some time
Found a girl, now I'm hers and she mine
And she made me feel whole, heal me
And it's mutual and we still in love

Can't you care for me?
Glad you care for me
