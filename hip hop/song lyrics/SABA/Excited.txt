Ay, yeah

All the baes on me, they biased
Put a few pounds, no diet
Got this shit down to a science
Yeah, I get so excited
I do not need no diamonds
She do not need no vices
We do not wait, not righteous
Yeah, I get so excited
All the baes on me, they biased
Put a few pounds, no diet
Got this shit down to a science
Yeah, I get so excited
I do not need no diamonds
She do not need no vices
We do not wait, not righteous
Yeah, I get so excited

I be on the road
'Nother dollar, 'nother day
If she tell me not to go
Then all I could do is wait
I said I be on the road
'Nother dollar, 'nother day
If she tell me not to go
Then all I could do is wait

Ayy, ayy, look
Heard your shit, it is not fire
New shit coming like a tidal wave
Been in that booth like five whole days
Chicago survival rate
I'mma keep it jazz like Johnny 'Trane
Y'all niggas countin' everybodies lane
Saba like [?] oh my god, ay
But I drop hits like Johnny Cage
Stage dive nigga, no shirt, red alert
And I'm from the same city, like Dirk, can't revert
To the same shit that make a baby burp
All gas, no brakes if I do I'll wanna skrr
Her favorite rapper Cardi so she told me "Okurr!"
And if I'm at a party then I'm first
I don't wanna judge, no this is not church
But if she wanna touch, the decision's hers
I may dance on another planet, Richard Branson

All the baes on me, they biased
Put a few pounds, no diet
Got this shit down to a science
Yeah, I get so excited
I do not need no diamonds
She do not need no vices
We do not wait, not righteous
Yeah, I get so excited

I be on the road
'Nother dollar, 'nother day
If she tell me not to go
Then all I could do is wait
I said I be on the road
'Nother dollar, 'nother day
If she tell me not to go
Then all I could do is wait
