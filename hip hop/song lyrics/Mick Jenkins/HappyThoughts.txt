[Yawns]
We're gonna do something a little different here for ya folks
Free...
[Clears throat, sniffles]
It's gonna be really groovy, man

Marijuana rollin'
Keep them bottles comin', models comin'
Take a seat, be fake with me cause they know I got dollas comin'
This is what it takes to be happy?
Please...
Don't let them bleed yo' mind
My nigga just free yo' mind
I hope you can see it nigga, been prayin' for peace/piece of mind

Chiefin' on leafy greens and thinkin' just like LeBron
The 4th quarter's up on us, I'm hopin' we finish strong
Prop and Chris do too much I'm just hopin' we finish song
Niggas be smokin' with' us and hopin' to finish bongs
The quotes is what's really potent, the focus is on what's wrong
The message is in yo' mind, I'm hopin' you sing along
I know you gone listen close, I just hope that you see the prob

Marijuana rollin'
Keep them bottles comin', models comin'
Take a seat, be fake with me cause they know I got dollas comin'
This is what it takes to be happy?
Please...
Don't let them bleed yo' mind
My nigga just free yo' mind
I hope you can see it nigga, been prayin' for peace/piece of mind

Still feelin' peachy kings save this peach drink, they be divine
Calypso it be the bomb, tell 'em about it Mick
HappyNess is for the free, you can tell 'em about the clique
How we tell 'em about our hearts, or we tell 'em about a brick
Gotta break it down for these niggas then sell it out on the strip
Off the strength
We isn't whack
And they feelin' a couple tracks
And I'm movin' like Nicky Bond so I'm flipin' a couple packs, of this brick
Music you hearin' I'm chillin' with all my niggas
New Amsterdam in my Sprite
I'm happy without that life
A master plan in my sights
Keep it tight
When I right, fool
And keep that

Marijuana rollin'
Keep them bottles comin', models comin'
Take a seat, be fake with me cause they know I got dollas comin'
This is what it takes to be happy?
Please...
Don't let them bleed yo' mind
My nigga just free yo' mind
I hope you can see it nigga, been prayin' for peace/piece of mind

Free
I told you it was gonna be groovy man
