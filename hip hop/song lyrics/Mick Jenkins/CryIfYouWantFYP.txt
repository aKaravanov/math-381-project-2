Ya party on my own shit
Probably leavin early on some grown shit
Lil baby lil booty got the force
And of course, 30 of the same niggas come up short
This some attack of clones shit
Lady I'm no jedi with these red eyes
I've been squinting to see
Something better, your addition makes no difference to we
Got my woman, you bet I don't got bitches with me
I'm like popeye off his spinach
I need feta, I need cheddar
What I don't need is these niggas trying to whisper to me
When the music is loud, while I'm twisting this tree
And don't go fixing your lips to kick up some fiction
We well equipped for the friction, you talkin slick you should quit it
My nigga give me some space
This ain't the time or place
I'm trying to catch me a vibe
And you coming all up in my face

Ay fuck your party

Niggas in here mobbin on some clone shit
Niggas in here ashy, need some lotion
I move with oceans, they know I swim good
I'm poured up, this water potent
They know I sip good
I sin bad, I try to tip good
I'm growing, still loaded
Uploading, upgrading
Upholding these statments
I'm focused, I'm smoking

I might blow a whole zone in this mother fucker
I might blow the ozone in this mother fucker (loud)
I might blow a whole zone in this mother fucker
