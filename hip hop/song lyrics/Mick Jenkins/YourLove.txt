I know you feel that, girl.)
Had to hold it down for the love
She the type of woman make you wanna leave the drugs
(Had to hold it down!)
I’m the type of nigga that don’t really do the club
Flaming water, double cup, baby let me know what’s up
(Oh… we could have a dream.)

Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago
Have a dream dream dream
Fall in love love love
I want to love you
I want to love you
(You know I need your love)
I want your love, love, love, love, love, love, love
I want to love you
I want to love you
(You know I need your love)
I want your love, love, love, love, love, love, love

Pardon me for standing in your sunshine, lady
Let me parlay with you for the one time, lady
I can promise it’d be a fun time
I ain’t tryna run game, or hit you with a sublime, lady
I want your love, love, love, love, love, love, love
I want to love you
(OOhh…)
5'3" with the Crown Royal skin-tone
Plus she brought her own water
Man, she been on
Per the joints; she hit me with a couple pearls of wisdom
Now it’s on, had me open like a flip-phone
Flip-mode, every single night is buzzin'
We be learnin' till we leanin' like we off the Robitussin
Keep the pace slow
Movin with the tempo, know you feel it when the bass low
Waitin' on the break down
I don’t need a peso
Did it for the lo-lo girl, the free, it’s what I’m based on
Come and feel with me
We could be a couple; Mase Songs
No insurance, it explodes!
Just state farm
Hold on, Lady
Stay calm

We can have a dream in New Orleans

Fall in love love love

(You know I need your love)
I want your Love love love love love love love
I want to love you
I want to love you
I want your Love love love love love love love

Had to hold it down for the love
She the type of woman make you wanna leave the drugs
(You know I need your love)
I’m the type of nigga that don’t really do the club
Flaming water, double cup, baby let me know what’s up
(Oohh)
