We, left school
We, learned late
We, seen scene
We, jazz June
We, die soon
We, die soon
We, die soon with your cool ass
With your cool ass
Real cool, with your cool ass
With your cool ass
Die soon
We, real cool
We, left school
We, learned late
We, seen scene
We, jazz June
We, die soon
We, die soon
We, die soon with your cool ass

Quick fast, quick fast, plus one that's quick math
Quicksand, sink slow for some quick cash
Quit that, got a better chance with bitcoin
Big banks see you stuntin' and this shit's deep
Crypt keep and now you're fucking with the block chain
Speed race until we running out of octane
I brought loud, you brought Reggie that's a mismatch
We not on the same page, it's just no, no way
Can't sauce through the beef this ain't bowling aye
Don't get mad because I roll it straight
Bowl a strike, new pants and I feel I need some more again
Tryna write while they bite, I'm not Holyfield
Disagree with the nigga but they know you real
They gon' see for themselves, know I told you so
Can't teach and young nigga, he don't want to know
Could be a flower, he don't want to grow

Real cool
We, real cool
We, left school
We, learned late
We, seen scene
We, jazz June
We, die soon
We, die soon
We, die soon with your cool ass
With your cool ass
Real cool, with your cool ass
With your cool ass
Die soon
We, real cool
We, left school
We, learned late
We, seen scene
We, jazz June
We, die soon
We, die soon
We, die soon with your cool ass

Pardon my judgement, and its worth
I'm trying to be reflective, don't mean to be overt with it
All this shit connected no cursive, it's more cohesive than simple calligraphy
Figure me, a whole different nigga than what I was meant to be
A whole different mental, with a stencil and it was incidental
This was way before followers when I was following
Wasn't until a bit later when I started flowering
And I needed pollination not your validation
Til they tell you, you ain't shining that's the provocation
I be speaking on the humble in the conversation
Who would think that I still copped a Cuban link
It was thrifting, now it's Barney's it's that newer mink
Barnes & Noble savage army nigga, who you read?
One stroke of the pen for your eulogy
You should leave, if not shit new to me
You niggas be too cool for me
Too many social rules for me
That superficial shit ain't fooling me
I'm in the party and this nigga thinks he's schooling me

Real cool
We, real cool
We, left school
We, learned late
We, seen scene
We, jazz June
We, die soon
We, die soon
We, die soon with your cool ass
With your cool ass
Real cool, with your cool ass
With your cool ass
Die soon
We, real cool
We, left school
We, learned late
We, seen scene
We, jazz June
We, die soon
We, die soon
We, die soon with your cool ass

You niggas be too cool for me
Too many social rules for me
