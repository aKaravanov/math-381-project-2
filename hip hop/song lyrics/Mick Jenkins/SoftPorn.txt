You can even take the gold off
We don't need no triggers
Honest as Abe Lincoln
Why do it feel like I take it?
What's so hard about the naked truth?
I scream about it until I change it
And still I wonder am I breaking through at all?

But hey, but hey, we look good
We a real nice, black
Dark chocolate, ain't no more sitting in the back
Ain't got to front, I know what you want
I could meet you where you at
With the naked truth

Talk dirty to me with it too, give me hot takes
Give me proof, give a chance to prove, let a man improve
Imma say I grew, they gon' say I pulled a switch-aroo
But they is who? All that jogging in place is cool
But that shit stayed in school for me partly because
Somebody was brutally honest
Pointed out social constructs, I foolishly honored
I booted the false concepts that diluted the water
Was tryna be true to the nigga I was claiming to be
Now I'm really real
Tryna get old like a Philly Shell
Don't nobody want no smoke with me, from spoken words of poetry
The polarizing social content posted I got more of the type and it all took a sprite
From advice from one that wouldn't consider nice, that's alright, it helped me take flight
I used to fall, but the flow is so velvety that we still had the Velveeta stacking nice
Really flexing our appetizing, I ain't stressing too hard

But hey, but hey, we look good
We a real nice, black
Dark chocolate, ain't no more sitting in the back
Ain't got to front, I know what you want
I could meet you where you at
With the naked truth

I dare you to strip it down, it's plenty dollars out here
They'll pay you to keep it on, they'll pop your collar as long as you go and play the role
I'm popping bottles of starch, niggas know I can't fold
I hope your water as smart as you claim to be online
They call you by your username offline, I usually pay no mind
I just cannot get used to niggas using that shit to define themselves
You'll lose me every time trying to align myself with real niggas
You confuse me every time you say that you feelin’ free
Can't see where my ceiling be
Think that's why those trapped in boxes can't see where I'm coming from
We just ain't there mentally
Expose myself to myself what the fuck you running from fam?
We can feel your energy
The hate gon' always gonna cost you so the love is complimentary
Wallet full of centuries I still can't get the time back
Protect the pocket like a lineback
Where these niggas draw the line at?
Don't let me find out that they don't draw one at all
I spit the naked truth, I'm drawing it raw
I speak on it all, not peaking at all
No valleys in sight, I rally to fight
For the naked truth
