My piss ain't never been so clear
My pockets never been so empty
My heart ain't never been this full
But my stomach is not so my nigga don't tempt me
I'm hungry, I'm thirsty, I'm tired, I'm smoking it off
It seems like everyone is only lost in dreams
And I'm getting lost in the thought of myself tryna wake niggas up like a coffee bean
She called my vices
We was at Starbucks gettin' lost in these carmel apple spices
Conversation all but prices, topics ranged from the innermost thoughts to all the trifling shit on Worldstar
Another soulless systems, and other planets of people, and how close our worlds are
And how she don't ever really smoke but how nice my pearls are

[Jean Deaux:]
I feel like water baby
Heal my body baby
You soothe my aching soul can feel like water baby
To soothe my aching soul can feel like water baby
Heal my body baby
To soothe It's so my aching soul

[Mick Jenkins:]
Cause life got a nigga stressed out
It ain't all just about rap no more
My name just like my phone and it buzz so much I don't even text back no more
I done sold so many clothes I don't even gotta pack no more
Just throw it all in one bag, break it down and roll it all in one joint
Take a puff and blow it all in one drag
We gone with the wind
Out in Montreal somewhere where your French don't gotta be excused
French inhales with some friends with my quality of life on the fringe I just see it as a muse
Everybody hurts, I just deal with the abuse
Passion of Christ with my pen to the pad
Your passion for life will exceed the paper just a sip of the holiest water he has

[Jean Deaux:]
I feel like water baby
Heal my body baby
You soothe my aching soul can feel like water baby
To soothe my aching soul can feel like water baby
Heal my body baby
To soothe It's so my aching soul

[Jean Deaux:]
Call him Confucius
Piercin' inside my mind
Truth is within his eyes never told me a lie
But hold me up to the sky
And ring me out till I'm dry
Never felt so alive
Call you when I might dive
Out the window floor 35
Tell me you not surprised
Can you sell your peace of mind
You my shooter, you my fuckin' savior
Let me rejuvenate ya
Open your mouth and let me fall into your solar plexus
Don't be so disconnected
I want to wash over your soul until you get the message
I wanna follow you straight home so you can finish stressin'
When you need fixin', give me 30 seconds
I'll cleanse you out until you all Qu'ran
Just give me bliss and if we kiss don't get too arrogant
Cause I've been missin', busy trippin' on how much it cost
And I am gifted with my hands, that's why I never lost
Cause when I stumble into you I knew that it was God
I know that

[Jean Deaux:]
I feel like water baby
Heal my body baby
You soothe my aching soul can feel like water baby
To soothe my aching soul can feel like water baby
Heal my body baby
To soothe It's so my aching soul
