Get high with a nigga one time, I won't have you on yo' ass
We can talk about some real shit, tell me how you feel
Tell me do you feel this, feel this
Just vibe with a nigga, one time with this joint
Get high with a nigga one time, I won't have you on yo' ass
We can talk bout some real shit, tell me how you feel
Tell me do you feel this, feel this
Tell me do you feel this
Tell Me do you yo feel this, feel this

Pendleton sweaters for the letters on some cool shit
All the writtens rapped in Woolrich, it's too cold
Let them niggas sneeze if they sick
Just don't ever bless the bullshit we too old
Paper twister I been organic no breaking Swishers
Just breaking habits, I pray for balance, I'm tasting scriptures
And hella vapors I'm painting pictures so pristine
Right on your ceiling the feeling is kinda Sistine
For the artform and never the hand clap
When that's clear you can call it Saran Wrap
Remember when you gettin' all this green
That there's gotta be sand traps
Derails don't only happen at Amtrak
If you don't understand that, well then my nigga, you special
Like cleft lips
How I stay on the upper up with the verbiage that I let go
This was never a game, and these was never no jokes
I'm impervious to your heckle
I'm Mr.Hyde Park worse than a Dr.Jekyll, ooh bad
Damn son you lookin' like Bill O'Reilly, you mad?
Our Bill of Rights from the past will never make it to the future
Even with a Martin Luther, fifty shades of Kama Sutra
We're fucked, so would you smoke with me?
I know this shit has been stressful, but would you cope with me?
I'm knee deep in these waters I'm asking you would you float
If you knew that I could build a boat
And I told you that God spoke with me

Just vibe with a nigga, one time with this joint
Get high with a nigga one time, I won't have you on yo' ass
We can talk about some real shit, tell me how you feel
Tell me do you feel this, feel this
Just vibe with a nigga, one time with this joint
Get high with a nigga one time, I won't have you on yo' ass
We can talk bout some real shit, tell me how you feel
Tell me do you feel this, feel this
Tell me do you feel this
Tell Me do you yo feel this, feel this

Feel the vibe I got some Gil Scott I know you like to snap to/too
Talk a couple black thoughts, spit 'em through this gap tooth
Just for the sheer thought that you listening let me express my gratitude
How can you hate on an attitude?
Know that's it's me my nigga he's too thorough
Been sowing seeds out in New York, niggas good in like two burrows
I been in the 514, french gettin to clean customs is routine eatin' hella poutine
I think I might buy one more
Connected with mines on the cusp of greatness if you didn't know
Now you know come and fuck with the free nigga
Fuck your lateness, this whole world is too fucking heinous
I seen some shit on the t.v that had fucked my day up
This life will fucking drain us, they tryna fucking train us
Niggas busy trappin', Didn't even get to see my granny before she passed cause I was too busy rapping
That type of shit will shift your whole perspective
Make you spit the type of shit to rip a whole collective
The pieces I been connecting the truth
I hope I connect with the thesis
But feel the vibe, I got some Sade I know that we can snap to
Knxwledge got some rap tapes I know that we can rap to
I'm a roll this joint and prolly light it
You can hit it if you want, but know that you don't really have to
I'm at you, and open with my intentions, I'll never be condescending
We'll do all the things I mentioned

Just vibe with a nigga, one time with this joint
Get high with a nigga one time, I won't have you on yo' ass
We can talk about some real shit, tell me how you feel
Tell me do you feel this, feel this
Just vibe with a nigga, one time with this joint
Get high with a nigga one time, I won't have you on yo' ass
We can talk bout some real shit, tell me how you feel
Tell me do you feel this, feel this
Tell me do you feel this
Tell Me do you yo feel this, feel this
