We in the whip, this my parking spot, I just bust a U
I just bust a U
In this classic whip
Pistol whip, I'm not sending shots I'm just busting heads
Smoke out the whip, this my parking spot, I just bust a U
I just bust a U
In this classic shit

Pistol Pete, when I got the rock and I'm passing it
I'm passionate, those stars trek like Spock cause I'm logical
It's fallacies, all up in your hearts, all up in your shoes
But tragedy, a cacophony causing causalities
I'm glad to be, black as coffee be on my Master P
My Cardi B, see I'm taking off like the breaks is off
Niggas grillin' like they all just got they fucking braces off
Talking love and they want to test my patience, oh?
Fuck passive aggressive shit, this shit sounding basic, oh?
Talk that pain and pleasure shit, they want more abrasive, oh?
My first name is Jayson, oh
You don't want me Voorhees cause you sleeping or ignoring
Anybody in here snoring better know that you can get

Pistol whip, I'm not sending shots I'm just busting heads
We in the whip, this my parking spot, I just bust a U
I just bust a U
In this classic whip
Pistol whip, I'm not sending shots I'm just busting heads
Smoke out the whip, this my parking spot, I just bust a U
I just bust a U
In this classic shit

I'm way too hot for the hot box, she want to see the moon through the sunroof
Diamonds on my right from the west side, south side niggas so uncouth
Oh, I don't ever tell no untruth's though
Niggas'll say that they feel you, they never fuck with the real you
I pull up on em in this pony and they get to acting phony
Please do not force my hand my nigga, you know that we ain't really homies
I never knew you like that, don't make me do you like that
Just bust a U turn before we have to get down like a new perm
We can straighten it out, just know that you can get

Pistol whip, I'm not sending shots I'm just busting heads
We in the whip, this my parking spot, I just bust a U
I just bust a U
In this classic whip
Pistol whip, I'm not sending shots I'm just busting heads
Smoke out the whip, this my parking spot, I just bust a U
I just bust a U
In this classic shit
