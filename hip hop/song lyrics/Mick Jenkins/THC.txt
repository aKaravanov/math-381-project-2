I'm gon' get you high
And honeys down the road, I'm crazy, I'm gon' get you high
Flawless gems, I'm no fugazi, I'm gon' get you high
And you ain't even gotta cop blunts
Nigga brought food for thought, so you ain't even gotta cop lunch
Bring it back like I'm gon' get you high
I'm gon' get you high
And honeys down the road, I'm crazy, I'm gon' get you high
Flawless gem, I'm no fugazi, I'm gon' get you high

Water is the most important natural component we have today
It makes up our world, our bodies
It has the ability to destroy, and create
It is the healing component, THC

Nigga brought food for thought, so you ain't even gotta cop lunch
