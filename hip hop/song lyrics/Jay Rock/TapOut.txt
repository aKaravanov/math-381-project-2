Closed eyes in the back

Got a text where you at, ayy
Only big flex where I'm at, ayy
Bouncing on the highway
Head on the highway, I only do it my way
I ain't gon' play with it, I'ma work it out
Stand up, while I lay in it
Couple hundred thou', dead mans in the safe with it

Fuck you in a car in the back, oh, yeah, yeah
Fuck you so good, call back, oh, yeah, yeah
