[Hook - Jay Rock:]
Keeping it G ain't nuttin, you ain't gotta like it cause the hood gone love it
You ain't gotta like it cause the hood gone love it
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public
I got the whole block bumpin
You ain't gotta like it cause the hood gone love it
You ain't gotta like it cause the hood gone love it
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public

[Verse 1 - Jay Rock:]
Na na na na now now you know what this is
Tell em it's a celebration bitches
Where the barbeque pits and the mini-bikes
Mini-skirts, Hennessys, and the Miller Lights
Domino tables, who got big 6?
Where I'm from we do concrete backflips
Flip flop flip flop flip flop back
Through the ghetto's where I bring hip hop back
Real niggas love me, they tell me keep it pushin
The only niggas be for waste out of central bookings
County jails and the lock downs up north
Said I should have it if Scarface pass the torch
That's how they feel Jack, built much more than rap
This that project haircut in the culdesac
This is where Jose front you them boulders at
Meet your quota whenever I put a quote on a track, nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Kendrick Lamar:]
From Compton to Baltimore I'm a kill it
I buy a morgue in a minute
The public house, the plastic couch of a section 8 tenant
The Regal window is tinted
The air conditioner broke but I'm cool enough to ensure you my ride is an Eskimo, huh?
And I peel off in the midst of getting my clothes off
And I thrive off energies from the inner cities that we lost, huh?
I'm putting the ghetto on top of my back
And I live in the back of the jungle
Lions, tigers, bears, oh my
Hear the siren, walk up, [*gunshot* *gunshot*] drive by
Shooters, looters, federal fed intruders
The engines on back of scooters
The real can recognize real and we need to know just who you are
You are in the presence of many presents
Kendrick the gift for the future oh yeah I said it
Thug life, good kid mad city mad respect representin the hood right

[Hook]

[Verse 3 Jay Rock]
The home girls tells me I'm the shit
I break them off so they can buy some outfits
I buy them sons a pack of peppers, some new Jordans
Give em the game, school em on what's really important
That's how I was raised, the og's had me
13 fresh off the porch, slangin' cabby
But I'm wiser now, show all my young niggas
There's other ways you get them dollars and funds nigga
Coming down in an old school, so cool
Whip like a fire ball call it so Goku
You don't know the tribulations that we go through
Put your ears to the speakers I'm a show you
I paint the picture so perfect
Hear my CD you see Mona Lisa in person
Courtesy of a hunnit beat
Got my crips and esse's at arm reach, 1 West
