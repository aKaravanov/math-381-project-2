Eastside, BH dub, you know about us
Get shot, or get robbed, we get dollars
Brick of blow, flip an Oz, hardly sniff it though
2 for 5 on a Friday, give and go
Bitch niggas wanna come and get a taste, they don't get it til they catch a red bottom to the face
No case, young nigga shootin' shit
I done delt in 88 with the temporary plates
Foreign cars but we dodge like bullets
Get to it, no talking, just do it
No swoosh, just killers off that kush
Me and Grizzley on the track we're both from the black book
All dirt, numbers scratched off that pistol
Selling crack viles out ya momma back window
Momma talking loud bout the shit that he into
She ain't gotta ask every month, what that rent do

You ain't know it real niggas don't sit still
If you knew a niggas story you would get chills
If you knew some of them secrets you would get killed
You ain't knowing shit real, shit chill, shit chill
You ain't knowing shit real, shit chill, shit chill
You ain't knowing shit real nigga

[Tee Grizzley:]
Say you wanna get rich, no matter the risk
No matter how far the trip, okay (okay let's get it)
Say you just wanna be on, you want the Rollie froze
You would never break the code, okay nigga
In Campanella, tell these niggas I'm at home there
(That's the crib nigga)
Blood, tell these niggas I'm at home there
(That's the motherfucking crib nigga)
Only Joy Road nigga that's good everywhere
One nigga, 2 stretch, bitch I double dare (brrah)
Money on the counter, chops on the floor
Besides the holy spirit, I ain't worried 'bout a soul
These niggas got a lot of mouth, ain't got no money though
(No money though)
And tell these niggas we can beef but don't get bloody though (It's gon' get bloddy)
90 days ago I was just in prison, I got out with a vision and now I'm with Jay Rock and Kendrick (Ain't it a blessing)
Out in Cali tapping in with the realest
When really I wasn't supposed to see the end of my sentence

[Jay Rock:]
You ain't know it real niggas don't sit still
If you knew a niggas story you would get chills
If you knew some of them secrets you would get killed
You ain't knowing shit real, shit chill, shit chill
You ain't knowing shit real, shit chill, shit chill
You ain't knowing shit real nigga
