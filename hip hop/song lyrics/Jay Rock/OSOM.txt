Out of sight, out of mind
Feelin' like, I'm runnin' out of time
Out of sight (out of sight), out of mind
Feelin' like, I'm runnin' out of time
Out of sight (out of sight), out of mind
Out of sight (out of sight), out of mind
Out of sight (out of sight), out of mind
Livin' life, like I'm runnin' out of time

[Jay Rock:]
Sometimes a nigga feel like everybody ain't real like Jonny Mckenzie
If I could pretend see, I wouldn't feel right
I bought a Dolce magnum
I just got signed
Everybody on my line, they wanna know the taxes
Do Rock got mansion? 30k to my moms
The hood turnt up, bitches, bottles, dope and all that stuff
For attention, high hopes and call my bluff
If anybody notes, when I lost love
Thing change, people change, niggas change, bitches change
Friend or foe, if or so, pick a lane
Lil' Wayne on my single now
Fucking hoes like I'm single now
Triggers close to my fingers now
But when the label frozed up, they all chosed up
They telling me, you a non-believer now
A felony, all I could think about
The cars go re-poed, the bills they add up
My bitch done left me, I smoked my last one
I'm high with no sleep, I pray a bag come
I just might grab one, I just might blast one of you
'Cause I ain't got nothin' to lose
But I got these wins to gain
And I don't feel comfortable
One thing that I've learnt all these years to block devils off of my ears
'Cause fairytales don't end well, when the fame and fortune not here
Everybody

[J. Cole:]
Promethezine in a baby bottle, meditating on daily dollars
Lately problems, stem from my bitch 'cause she know I still fuck with my baby mama
So there be drama
In the house, I got to find a outlet
Waitin' on a block, just like a fucking outlet
Fuck it, I'm turnin' my phone off
Fantasies of grabbin' the heat and burnin' my nose off (plow)
Niggas might not now, but I'm slightly thawed off
And I might need zoloff
But for now these xannies are due
Hear the sound, a manic depressive that ain't be prescript-ed, what can he do?
Anywho, boy, when you got it, you keep a close watch on the ones that's be-friending you (friending you)
That might be the ones that's envy you (envy you)
Vividly dreamin' 'bout endin' you (endin' you)
But when you low, they don't tend to you (tend to you)
Actin' all new when they run into you (into you)
Fuckin' your bitch tryna feel like you (feel like you)
This the message I sendin' you:
Look both ways, before you cross me I tell you
Look both ways, before you cross me I tell you
Look both ways, before you cross me I tell you
Look both ways, 'cause if you cross me, I kill you

[Jay Rock:]
Rippin' and runnin' wild
My mamma say, 'Slow it down', I don't listen to her
All of my felonies on foul
Sippin' liquor 'til my liver ruined
My partner just lost trail
This system'll give it to you when you getting to it
How could you came down
'Cause soon as it goes down, it's a pistol to it
G-ride special, it's a Buick
I'm guilty but I said I didn't do it
Pressure bust pipes like a gun fight
I ain't never bring a knife to it
I done been through it and I been through it
All the rara, I'm in a high rise
Instead of music and the interviewin', I could be a nigga dead interviewin'
Would you take a look inside of my eyes?
I'm surrounded by a bunch of blind guys
Out of sight and out of my mind
But y'all can never see me checking chicken fetticini
And I wish a nigga would when I'm in this Lamborghini
Top back in a bitty, top down on a Bentley
Top Dawg's on the map, we familiar with your ways
We don't even need the app
Sorry but I gotta ask, you running the trap or just running your trap?
I'm running amok, I'm rounding it up
Running across the finish line
Hope you worth more than your Rolex when you run up outta, time
