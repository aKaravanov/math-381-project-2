Bitch, I know about you
Hanging with LaQuita brought the hoe up out you
And now you acting like you don't know about it
Look I ain't really tripping, want some more about you
Now wait a minute
Bitch, I know about you
Why you snitching when nobody know about it
That's the wrong way to try to go about it
They go take your ass out with no deposit
Now pay attention

And that's the way
Pussy on my hotline, that's the way
Plans on my trap phone that's the way
Numbers in my paper bag, that's the way

[Hook - SiR:]
She gon' pop bottles, that's fo sho
When we roll up, she roll up, that's fo sho
She love ridin' high, sittin' low, that's fo sho
Don't matter where we go
Fo sho

I know you heard about me
Walk mellow talk mellow, plus I'm quiet as fuck
My exterior composed, but inside I'm a nut
And after drinks and a blunt, I'm redesigning your strut
Got you rewinding and take, wiling and smiling and such
Keep your vagina in touch, dialing my line in a cut
This hydrophonic and got you hot with the bottles and bubs
On top of that, this dick and dollars done got you in love
Now wait a minute

And that's the way
Pussy on my hotline, that's the way
Plans on my trap phone, that's the way
Numbers in my paper bag, that's the way

[Hook - SiR:]
She gon' pop bottles, that's fo sho
When we roll up, she roll up, that's fo sho
She love ridin' high, sittin' low, that's fo sho
Don't matter where we go
Fo sho

Big money, all hunnids
How you want it, we can run it
Ten boppers, they swing
Drop it low, do your thang, do your thang
Big money, all hunnids
How you want it, we can run it
Ten boppers, they swing
Drop it low, do your thang, do your thang

And that's the way
Pussy on my hotline, that's the way
Plans on my trap phone that's the way
Numbers in my paper bag, that's the way
