Mama says she love it when I'm color coordinated,
So I pull up in a barum coupe with maroon license,
And my supes outmaneuver like?
Maguiver when it's time to ride,
Say she always feeling blue
When he telling white lies
Rain on her window pain
All she see is grey skies
Told her hit this purple
Maybe this will ease your mind
I'm rocking purple lable
Check out my shirt design
Perfect with her purple kisses
Slack track number eight
From the tree maybe this is something you ain't neva see
Put you in a real world
Take you
Sippin on pink panties
In the stretched limousine
They takin of pink panties
When we hit the room please
Don't confuse me for no murdera like Norman beats
But I'm about to kill it
Pull out the yellow tape
I'm guessing I'm a criminal
You caught up in my web
Like a brovy clues
Hey that is a color never seen boe
