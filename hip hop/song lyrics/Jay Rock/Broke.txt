

Yeah
Yeah

Can I do my shits now?
Cane I be specific?
Can I chase this grip without looking too good for my bridges?
Am I too prolific?
The vision my pugilistic moods insisted
Food come from them tools he's so choosed to use
Now Harriet Tubman say she freed a thousand slaves
Could've freed a thousand more if they was aware of the chains
What's under the rugs remain unexplained
Truth is mostly taboo
Even when it's staring back at you like a enemy tattoo
Refusing to play the statue, I take action
Without quitting until I reach my point of satisfaction
Not giving a crap what happens
I'm just a part of a winning family, call me Marlin Jackson
As I'm working hard to get my spin right
Morphine and over cane and dollar pain
Still don't change the diagnosis
Pessimistic thoughts, carrying the bricks, we trying to find some hope
Most of counterparts, we feelings the same
Give me a light, let's smoke
You either chasing this dirty money or living rightoues broke

B is for the blood
R is for the roads
O is for the oppression
K is for the kush, needed just to cope
E is for the evolution, it's for this resolution
Now have you ever been broke, sick of forever losing?

The damage is done but who's to blame
Finger pointing, naming names
Nobody willing to pay that full admission to ride the gravy train
Death is a part of life, happens daily, gotta face the pain
I be limping through it with lacerations, both my ankles sprained
Can't rely on politics, all that 1% of the game power
Daily giving [?] to let that own your life for 8 hours
Poison get to waters, make it hard, safely take showers
Nobody put in place to keep it straight, so now we slang powder
Chasing paper, aiming lasers at the opposition
Can't play with these streets and say you positive
It's a contradiction
I ain't have no pot to piss in
Had to make some tough decisions
Tired of dealing with these broke conditions
Listen

B is for the blood
R is for the roads
O is for the oppression
K is for the kush, needed just to cope
E is for the evolution, it's for this resolution
Now have you ever been broke, sick of forever losing?
