90059 be the zip, it be the zip, it be the zip
90059 be the zip, it be the zip
90059 be the zip, it be the zip
90059 be the zip, it be the zip
90059 be the zip

I'm straight up out that East side, swangin' like ziplines
On Forgiato rim tires, automatic spit fire
'Gnac in a black canister, look at this bastard go
It don't take much to aim, fingers been snatchin' souls
Out on my grind, rhymin', stacking this cash to hold
And I could take you where them niggas get bodied
But that ain't nobody business, so what the fuck is you asking for?
Look, I'm just try'na blow good dope
And put my feet to the metal of life and see just how fast it goes
Fuck the world, gotta make that bitch grab her toes
And Rock game never groovy, no weapon shall prosper
Maneuver like I'm Bruce Lee, ya know I'm chucks
Been doing this since a young buck
Banging for fifty cent from a victim, while my gun talk
And somebody gotta get it
And when you make a dollar, know somebody gotta spend it

The struggle is real, the struggle is real, the struggle is real
You gotta do what you got to just to get over the hill
When you live in America, either kill or be killed, yo

[Hook:]
Lord have mercy, have mercy
I know I ain't living right and know I'm not perfect
But plus I gotta eat what I'm doing it's worth it
So, Lord have mercy

I stay at your head or be at your throat
Better ask your folk, I'm never the dawg to provoke
Niggas know the status and bitches come cast their votes
In my zone with codeine and plenty of grass to smoke
I'm surpassed and broke, stay trapping for mo'
Two chicks boosting, we hooking back up in the back of the sto'
I'm the jack of many trades, steady pimping my pen
Hustle in the shade, respond in a nigga's funny ways
I was raised by winners
Niggas who park benzes up at that Staples Center
Now that gangsta nigga, I'm on some new money
Nothing but raw, pop shit, catch one in the jaw
It's gutta law, I know, you wish you was a star
What I do is internal, smoking herbal
Try'na run up in some bitches who fertile, woah
Feel like this is my moment, feel it's time for change
Excercise in game, niggas vibe the change
No looking back at it, cause this is that moment
I step forward ready to go at each and every opponent
Give it to anybody that want it
Represent the underdog, training in the gym
Tell a minute, they get they number called
I'm speed bagging it's worth, the trainers see me smashing
With perspiration on the back of my shirt, making them sweat
Better yet, just look at them feds
Like when I'm in that Nicks, cashing a check, you know it's real nigga

The struggle is real, the struggle is real, the struggle is real
You gotta do what you got to just to get over the hill
When you live in America, either kill or be killed, yo

Lord have mercy, have mercy
I know I ain't living right and know I'm not perfect
But plus I gotta eat what I'm doing it's worth it
So, Lord have mercy
