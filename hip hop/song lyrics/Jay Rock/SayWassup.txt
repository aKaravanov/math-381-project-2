When you see me in your town say wassup
Roll around say wassup
Even ones who wear the crown say wassup

Blow a pound that’s wassup
Heyyy

[Ab-Soul:]
And my tail light broke like a promise, homie
It’s the realest shit I wrote, on my momma, homie
My teachers used to call my momma on me
Now im a rapstar and I could fuck up my momma’s homies
Me and schoolboy hit the liquor store
Chococalte swisher burnin slow, how sweet?
Who got the dro who tryna chief?
Like Pocahontas daddy and im off that granddaddy kush, im finna start a family

[Kendrick:]
Im ghetto, my kool aid need mo suga
5 star suite, you ain't know, suga? (you ain't know bitch?)
I’m chillin bumpin anita baker
Caked up, they wonder why I don’t need a baker
But really though I just need a hater
So I ask em for their number when I see a hater
Ask obama if I don’t know about presidents, keep them dead motherfuckers restin in my money clip

They know I put it down now they wanna say wassup
When you see me in your town say wassup
Roll around say wassup
Even ones who wear the crown say wassup
That’s wassup
Break it down that’s wassup
Dog pound that’s wassup
Heyyy

[Q:]
Look up in the mirror and my gangsta told me what it do?
Captain crunch and top ramen all a nigga ever knew
Got a bitch to twist a blunt and pop a nigga collar too
Who that nigga standin over there? That’s that nigga Q
What it do? Thas wassup, bang this in your tonka truck
Everybody rockin chucks and pistol packin that’s a must
Saggin and my ass showin mami and the cops knowin all I wanna do is smoke a blunt, let it bump

[Jay Rock:]
Yeah im lookin in the mirror and the nigga said wassup, Rock?
And that nigga looked back at me and said boy you certified
Took my 87 regal put it in a chop shop
Stash spot, 45
Run up, you gonna die
Lookin for a pretty bitch who can twerk it and throw it back
Nigga diss me, no I ain't missin im throwin shots back
Jay rock, top cat, and im still a top dawg
Boxed in that Porsche box like im fighting south paw

They know I put it down now they wanna say wassup
When you see me in your town say wassup
Roll around say wassup
Even ones who wear the crown say wassup
That’s wassup
Break it down that’s wassup
Dog pound that’s wassup
Heyyy

[Kendrick:]
We all amazing, you all can hate it, you can live or die that’s your ultimatum
Married to the game at the alter wasted
A pound of white rice on the side by Asians

[Q:]
Niggas didn’t ride for me, bitches didn’t sign me
And whats the one thing they hated most?

[Jay Rock:]
