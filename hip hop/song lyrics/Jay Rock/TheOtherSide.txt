90059, we them zip holders
Brick runners, real hunters, Cosa Nostra
Got dope for your nostrils too
First parking lot, three doors down (We got you, Rock)
Cutter niggas with the shit and we got bread
Big chopper turn your dome piece to a drop-head
Ain't nothing like a project bitch
Making that cal fresh and cal word flip
We set up shop and sling nicks out our house
If police hit, ain't shit coming out our mouths (Solid)
My day one niggas, yeah, my niggas I'm thugging with (Solid)
Trey-eight specials, four-fours, we sluggin' shit
You ain't know? (You ain't know?)
That's why them bammers in the hood now
They inchin' to get a little footage to shut the hood down (Down)
But we here to stay
Why Watts, nigga, we don't play
I'll tell you why, nigga (Tell you why, East Side)

[DCMBR:]
Running from the cops, bustin' potshots, aiming at my enemies
Everybody gotta die but come across me, I'ma kill first 'fore you kill me, ayy
'Cause all the guap, all the knots, all the scars that I got, it started off the block, ayy
Grass ain't greener on this side and on the other side my gun still cocked
'Cause it started off the block

[Mozzy:]
Ride with the yeeky that's cause it's mandated (Gangland)
All type of glickeries, little hand caters (Gangland)
Eager to get it, they told me have patience
Land at your resi', they got a bag waiting
We pulling up for it, we in the bag claimage
They keep it copacetic 'cause we act faded (Act faded)
Body for body, it's really that gangster (Yeah)
My bitches be trafficking off of Backpages
One fourth of a million, this all rap paper (This all rap paper)
'Nother fourth of a million, that's out the trap paper (That's out the trap paper)
The Five-O circle and double back later
10 P's of Cookie in the duffle, double that later
Lot of niggas traded on us during offseason
Get you some guala and watch how the peasants all greasy
If I could call a dead homie, I would call Deezy
He was tapped in with all the leaders that we all needed

[Jay Rock:]
You either pray or play for your team, that's red or blue
Make sure you got bleach to get rid of that residue
No chill dealin' with rule breakers and vandals
Blowers in the bando, fitteds with the flannel
East Side Johnny and them, a bunch of have nots
Out to reinforce the blacktop, watch the backdrop
I represent, from that nick, it's an aspect
You ain't down to toss the dice for yourself? You side bet
We live threats, gotta flip, take it off
Fuck 'em all, gotta ball, we stuck in that mindset
And the belly of the beast is some shit you can dissect
Food for thought, this reality, shit you can digest
They feel some type of way, oh yeah, we see the curve
Ray Bans on in the summer and then we swerve
East Side shit, nothing is by the book though
I ain't prejudge you, just keep your ear to the hook, though (East Side)
