Dear God, I wanna thank you for this bad bitch I got on my side
Dear God, I wanna thank you for letting me be a real nigga
Dear God, I wanna thank you for giving me a second chance
Dear God, I wanna thank you for all these dollars and gold

Top off, drop off (Where the cash at?)
Top off, drop off (Where the cash at?)
You ain't me, nigga
Knock it off! (Where the cash at?)
You ain't me, bitch
Knock it off! (Where the cash at?)
Top off, drop off (Where the cash at?)
Top off, drop off (Where the cash at?)
You ain't me, nigga
Knock it off! (Where the cash at?)
You ain't me, bitch
Knock it off! (Where the cash at?)

Eastside Johnny on one, ain't no question what it is
2-2-3, I'll let you hold one if you come between my hands
I'ma slide into the streets, I'ma slide into the pen
Politicking on the yard, drop your ass off a tip
I don't trust nobody, but my daughter and my shotty
If it blasts - that's a bag, if he leave [?] body
2-door seats, you know me
Windows tinted, so the Lord don't see
I like top when she all on me
Panties drop when they call on me
Skin-tight favorite, the red Cortez
Clip playin' in, but it's one in the head
Girl don't play with it, heard what I said?
Girl don't play with it, heard what I said?
Ain't no stains upon my suede
I been high for like 4 days
On the vibe for like 4 days
Catchin' fades and runnin' plays
God damn

You ain't me, nigga
Knock it off! (Where the cash at?)
You ain't me, bitch
Knock it off! (Where the cash at?)
Top off, drop off (Where the cash at?)
Top off, drop off (Where the cash at?)
You ain't me, nigga
Knock it off! (Where the cash at?)
You ain't me, bitch
Knock it off! (Where the cash at?)

I'm on 10
I go in
I just pop
I just win
Off the lot
In a win
I am Rock
Who is him?
Fuck you doin'?
Get a bag
Sellin' work
In a lab
Smokin' purp
In a Lamb
Pull up, skrrrt!
Rari, fast
Off the porch, tendencies
Two for one, ten a piece
Fuck them ones, takin' [?]
Add two, twelve deceased
Pour one for Stephen Clark
Than jump in and push the start
If I say this caviar, nigga
I ain't mad at ya
God damn

Knock it off! (Where the cash at?)
You ain't me, bitch
Knock it off! (Where the cash at?)
Top off, drop off (Where the cash at?)
Top off, drop off (Where the cash at?)
You ain't me, nigga
Knock it off! (Where the cash at?)
You ain't me, bitch
Knock it off! (Where the cash at?)
