Head on a swivel, rotation
I got the backdoor swinging, rotation
If it's war, double back and rotation
If it's war, double back and rotation

112th street, dude, slime, tell a friend
Parking lots, dope spots, hard rock, I'ma get
Dude get out and shoot it out
Fuck a opp, who was him?
Pack it out, I stall him out
We need to find out where he live
GTA, 2 elevens, double dutching, Mack-11s
Section 8, welfare, EBTs on the dresser
Crash dummies, real killers
Fast money kill niggas
Blast for me, real nigga
Ask for me, deal with you
Pay your fare, play it fair
Here's a scale, weight it here
Kick a door, head choke
Take it all, hit the stairs
Yellow bricks, peddle bricks
Get a ounce, get a zip
Shawty bounce, hit his hip
Make them body do a flip
I'm a vet, I'ma rep
I'm a boss, I'ma flex
I'ma turn up for the set
Take this bottle to the neck
Pre-rolls for the hoes
More licks for the homies
Five hundred for the K, share it with the members only

Pull up, pop shit
Hop out drop shit
Chopsticks on me

Tell all the real niggas, let's pledge allegiance right now
Okay, I slide by myself, I don't need no help (that's right)
Chopper on the seat, no safety belt (say what?)
