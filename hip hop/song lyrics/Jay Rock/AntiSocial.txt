Yeah
I like this right here
See stuff like this
You just speak what you feel like
I mean you just say whatever is on your mind, like you know
When I say things, I just want people to feel me
You feel me?

(That's right)

Dwelling with my killers
Smoking good,
Blowing on that killa
Word on the streets,
People want to kill us
We got choppers,
They don't want to feel it
Say they want problems
Man, forget their feelings
Hackers and nerds
We are natural born killers'
Bustin down birds
Tryin to get a million
But we gotta eat
Feedin all our children
Getting paper
Stack it to the ceiling
Straight gutter
Heart colder than a blizzard
Leaning of the sizzerb [?]
Twisting up the hizzerb
Soc be the name game
Sharper than some scissors
Baby what it is?
Tell me what the wizzord
You can dance
I'm a whistle as you twizzorl
Keep it live
365
Got my chest out and my head to the sky
But

I'm so antisocial
Cause fake whack haters I can't stand close to
Some of these people actin like they know you
But as the world turns only time will show you
That's right (that's right)

Looking good in my chevy
Wish my granny could see me
Rest in peace mimi
Wish my daddy could se me
But the lord took him away
All I have now is mimis to play
Can somebody tell me why the ones you love the most
Always be the ones that go
Got my gun on my shoulders and my heart on my sleave
Make every moment count never know when your soul gotta leave
Just to escape from stress, I watch the tv
Sit so close to the screen I'm not able to see
Forget friends, all I have is me
Keep your enemies close
Cause family envy
That's cold blooded
That's my life and it's rough
Gat in my palm running your mouth then I'm gonna bust
I ain't a hater, my homie I don't cuff
Jealousys the root of evil
And ladies I don't trust

I'm so antisocial
Cause fake whack haters I can't stand close to
Some of these people actin like they know you
But as the world turns only time will show you
That's right (that's right)
I'm so antisocial
Cause fake whack haters I can't stand close to

I just mind my business
And do what I'm supposed to, man
Represent the apple, keep it real on garageband
Why every year I lose someone that I'm close to
That's why I stay strapped in every club that I walk through
Never know, crazy whack haters might hawk you
Stalk you, spock you, shell put a part through
Gat in my car when I ride in the dark too
When I let it off it's a light now say goodnight (goodnight)
Is that simple homeboy,
Shoot your fingers throwing up the wrong symbol homeboy
And we could clash like a thimble homeboy
Rase the bar, duck shots if you can do the limbo homeboy
(Oh boy!)
You're not a limber homeboy
You can get stretched out running the motor in your mouth
That's why

I'm so antisocial

That's right (that's right)
