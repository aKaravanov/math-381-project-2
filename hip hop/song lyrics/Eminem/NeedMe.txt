[Pink:]
You're drunk
The carpet is burned
I hate to find you like this
I always find you like this
I come home and clean up your mess
What would you do without that?
Why do I always come back? Oh
What I wouldn't do for you

And I'm starting to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need-ed me
And I'm starting to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need-ed me

[Pink & Eminem:]
Some nights I want to run for the hills
It's never easy with you
I cannot reason with you
But your smile is as rare as it comes
What would I do without that
Maybe that's why I come back
Oh, what I wouldn't do for you

[Pink:]
And I'm starting to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need-ed me
And I'm starting to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need-ed me

[Eminem:]
Starting to think we were made for each other
But one of us in this relationship is raising the other
You remind me of my mother
We drive one another as crazy as each other
And we're both adults so there's no excuse for the games that we play with each other
Where you at? At a friends?
No you ain't, motherfucker
But I give her the benefit of the doubt
Whenever the doubt kicks in, shiver
When I touch her, cause I love her so much, I'm a sucker
Our bottom lip can quiver when she's in trouble, she's in hot water
Think I caught her cheating again
Give her another chance? Another one after that?
I'm swimming in that Egyptian River cause I'm in denial
Say I don't need shit, but I have a shit-eating grin when I smile
Making an excuse for us to act it out
She's just acting out, with her inner child
Then I set the truth on fire
Cause I'd rather believe a lie then breathe a sigh of relieve that I don't believe in
Going to bed mad
I keep on trying to make a bad girl good
But have a nice goodbye, you in good times
In bed, I'm starting to feel like you're god damn dead
'Cause I literally feel like you could die of a "should I
Leave you for good?", and never would I
It'd be all bad, never understood why they call it goodbye
But I think I'm a pretty damn good guy
And you're a good person too
I can save you, I can make you change
But I keep puttin' my fuckin' foot in my mouth
Every time I gotta come and bail you out
When you get in trouble that you get yourself in
And I'm in trouble but I can't leave, I'll sell you out
I could never turn my fuckin' back on you..what is that?
I'm co-dependent, I'm just now noticin' it
But somehow it's like every time I'm about to go to end it
I ain't got the cojones to do it, nor the heart
Our apartment's tore apart
You're usin' my heart for a dartboard
But God must've aligned stars for us
'Cause somebody paired us up
And they say He ain't capable of makin' a mistake
But this one's perfect, 'cause I'm...

[Pink:]
And I'm starting to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need-ed me
And I'm starting to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need-ed me
