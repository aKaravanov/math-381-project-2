And this goes out to everybody who doubts, runnin' ya mouth
And don't know what you talkin' 'bout
You ain't familiar wit' the D, don't go that route
Just keep ya hand on ya toolie if ya walkin' 'bout
It's all live now
And for the greatest amount
But make the ladies say Oh

Turnin' it out

[Q-Tip:]
Word up
It's The Love Movement, it's all love
'Cause we make ma-fuckas be fond of us
We like the ladies, intelligent ones
But when the lights go out it's time to fondle us
It's apprehension, when playin' ya joint
'Cause Jay Dee makes it sound so marvelous
If you beefin', then settle ya soul
While we make all of y'all just bond wit' us
Got your work on you, you better put it away
Police be lookin' for the vandalous
Jay Dee from the D, SV family
Phife, these jokers can't handle us

Do do do, do do do, do do do, do do do do
Do do, do do do do, do do, do do do do

And all these ladies seem to be…
(They seem to come in flanks, yo
Because I'm, nice with mines, mad nice with mines
Nice with mines, mad nice with mines, yo, word
Nice with mines, crazy nice with mines
Once again, son, I'm nice with mines
Check it)

[Phife Dawg:]
Phife can make it iller with the dominant flows
Put the bite back in it while the confidence grows
Dawg got flea-bitten written, I stay shittin'
On competition, we hittin' like Cal Ripken
Brothas is playtime like Animaniacs
We be puttin' in real time, that's why y'all bangin' that
Niggas can face off but can't get shorty
I make y'all erase off 'cause y'all ain't naughty
What's up to Treacherous, let's get it in line
It's the girls who's sweatin' us, let's make 'em refined
You got to, make it hot for the hoods in the street
Wack producers need to stop with them crackhead beats
