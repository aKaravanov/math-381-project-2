Cindy Lou who
I live in Who
-Ville who are you?
I got a dog
His name is Max
Coffee in my cup
That is a fact
I was in snow
Ain't need a coat
Max with the sled
Off with their head
I don't like love
I don't like fun
When I'm around
Christmas is done

(Show me some love)
I am the Grinch
Hey how you doing, you scum is a pleasure to meet you
(Show me some love)
I am the Grinch
I'm here to ruin your day to swoop in and defeat
(Show me some love)
I am the Grinch
I get to ride and ride and ride around
(Show me some love)
I am the Grinch
That's what they call me when they talk about me around the town

You're the Grinch, you're the Grinch
(That's me!)
You're so problematic, you're the Grinch
(Hello)
You're the Grinch, you're the Grinch
(I'm guilty)
You're so problematic, you're the Grinch
(Yeah, yeah)
You're the Grinch, you're the Grinch
(At your service)
You're so problematic, you're the Grinch
(Nice to meet you)
You're the Grinch, you're the Grinch
(Ok)
You're so problematic
(That's ice on em, ice)
(That's ice on em, ice)
(That's ice on em, ice)
(That's ice on em, ice)
(That's ice on em, that's)

25, 25, 25, 25
25 days in a month
25 days is enough where I don't give a-wait a minute!
25 days got the lock with the chain at the door
Don't knock, no gifts over here
I don't smell nothing in the air
You can take that over there and I don't really care
Tell your homeboy in a red suit to chill
Before I ban him from Whoville
I ain't playing with you

11 days coming up boy
25 ain't enough, yeah
I just hope you have a Merry Christmas, yeah
Jingle Bells, can you hear them bells
It's them Jingle Bells in the front, yeah
I just hope you have a Merry
