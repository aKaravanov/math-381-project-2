[Verse 1: Meech]
I am redesigning the mind of the masses
That fear a black man with tattoos and bandanas
But when a white man wear tattoos and bandanas
And joins a bike gang it's all cool with the balance.
Hate my black flesh, but you're mad that I came up
You cannot change, rearrange my chemical make-up
Pigmentation, annunaki blood, who just wanted to make ya astral project blood
Outta the matrix, you fake fucks plagurus
I make a whore drop drugs with my cranium, telepathy,
Host with the most, you can't find a better beast
Better off dead, sever off heads
Ever since I blew up niggas think I got bread
So they got their hands out, they gon' get their palms read
Red from all the bloodshed

[Hook: Meechy Darko]
Load it up my nigga, bang bang
Cook that rock nigga, slang 'caine
Point your finger, play the blame game
Fuck it dog it's the American way
Get high my nigga, maintain
Sell lies, chase fame
Cause if they could they would still hang
Trust me dog it's the American way

[Verse 2: Erick Ark Elliot]
Music my own drug the beauty through the people
Niggas will never change unless you thinkin' you need to
We rebuild and destroy, home of the unemployed
We callin' it rap, while you callin' it noise
So evacuate your homes, radios never play my favorite song
Miss America would never be black, no use in tellin' me that
Everybody could coincide, it could never be that
Good riddance to the realest, but you gotta feel us
Gettin cash every day twistin flame Herbal Phillips
Stereotype, never marry a wife
Just another block nigga making music, maybe you right
Most definitely and you questioning me
If the world fucked up the exception is me
Government love guns till they aimed at you
No tellin what I might do for the red white and the blue

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Zombie Juice]
Oh shit, Oh Lord
Here we go again finna get these packs off
Repetitive sedative, got a fetish for fetishes
An American menace, I'm manifesting my businesses
Realest as realest gets, terror the terrorists
If you put your hands out I'm a crush your fingertips
Fuck Bloomberg, that man absurd
Throw him in the trunk right up on the curb
Hop out mash out leave his ass thurr
Niggas talk shit but I don't feel words
Better of dead, prepare for the worse
Been slaved since the my first day on this earth
Fuck social security and fuck homeland security
9/11 biggest fraud in history
And all you rappers ain't shit to me
Getting fucked by a label
Fame chasing bitch chasing lonely ass nigga probably
Go and snitch you ain't going to face it
In debt to the red white and blue
Your government lies so who the fuck is you

[Hook]
