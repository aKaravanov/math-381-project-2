

I lift my hands up high for another night
Cause I lost wings and I wanna fly
I even wash my face in the river Nile
I'm a pray all day 'til I get it right

Before I leave the crib I know I say my prayers
Pray to God I'm happy every single day I swear
More money I'm more prepared more niggas that's unaware
Most niggas don't even listen they only see what they hear

My mind ain't certain
That I put enough work in
These beats, these streets, no purpose
Repeat, rebuild, resurface
No longer in disturbance
Get a shooter if your nervous
Stressed out made a nigga feel worthless
Can't nobody fuck up on purpose (on purpose)
I remember when I had no government
My name was so crazy, had lines like cocaine
And those the good days, I got them good grades
Had profit to get paid, I made some mistakes
That's something we all gone say
Had to ignore a bitch called today
But a little bit of head made it all okay
If you niggas want a war then my boys gone play

Before I leave the crib you better say your prayers
Niggas trigger happy every single day I swear
More murder I'm more aware, more bullets I'm more prepared
Most niggas don't even listen that's until they hear the bang

My mind's uncertain, do I put enough work in
Red rum red rum, bloody murder
Head shot, close range, close curtains
No encore that's for certain
Clack clack, bravo, I murked 'em
Hoes, clothes, more drugs, more murder
More guns, more drugs, more murder (more murder)
In the ghetto where the rats eat roaches
Gats tucked in our drawers, we don't need holsters
You gone learn today, you gone get involved
We scamming, drug dealing, prostitution and all
In the ghetto praise to God alike a long distance call
I done rang Jesus for years, fuck it, no response
What? I'm supposed to sit and starve
Ha! Gat in my palm and taking your be my job
I don't want to shoot and steal
I don't want to kill and rob
I just want to provide
For my momma, my poppa, my kids and I
I just want to provide
For my bitch, and my homies that's from my side
But I came straight from homicide

Before I leave the crib I know I say my prayers
Pray to God I'm happy every single day I swear
More money I'm more prepared more niggas that's unaware
Most niggas don't even listen they only see what they hear

Before I leave the crib you better say your prayers
Niggas trigger happy every single day I swear
More murder I'm more aware, more bullets I'm more prepared
Most niggas don't even listen that's until they hear the bang
