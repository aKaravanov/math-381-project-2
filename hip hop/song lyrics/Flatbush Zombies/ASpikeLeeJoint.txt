[Hook:]
Unsigned and independent
Look tell my moms I did it
When you risk your life constant struggle to survive
Yeah yeah oh woah
Unsigned and independent
I move a mile a minute
When you risk your life, constant struggle to survive
Say yeah oh woah

[Verse 1 - Erick The Architect:]
Dirty money clean money, niggas see the difference
Tell the bartender leave some liquor for my niggas
Streets full of wolves so my appetite grew
I was hungry for this rap shit way back in high school
Motivated knocked somebody off to break the rule
Coordinated mind-frame slaughtering your view
Smoking on this green trees I don't get the blues
If I see a nigga lurk then I gotta tuck a deuce
I was clocking out of work
'Round the same time I was writing out of thirst
Working three jobs I ain't want to buy the purp
Friends'll leave ya cold turk'
It was ADHD smoking weed before church
Now I'm back for 'em, tap dance on the platform
With the mask on
Hit the squad for the [bat phone]
Wilding, want it now I gotta last long
Dog, I just get a bigger jawn if he act raw

[Hook:]
Unsigned and independent
Look tell my moms I did it
When you risk your life constant struggle to survive
Yeah yeah oh woah
Unsigned and independent
I move a mile a minute
When you risk your life, constant struggle to survive
Say yeah oh woah

[Verse 2 - Juice:]
Dirty money, clean money can you see the difference?
Got a phone call from my baby mama tripping
Views like, fuck life what it's worth
Used to smoke mad weed before my girlfriend went to church
Had no ID, hip hop before I started bumping Eazy-E
When ringtones was the hot shit
And B.I.G. on my conscience when I spit
And NYPD, on my dick since I've been
Fornicating, investigations
Don't got no patience, all this bread I'm making
Used to fuck bad bitches when my grandma's on vacation
Call a bitch over then she dipped for the weekend
Couple safes in my brib two phones in [?]
[?] cess on her ass like a LA Dodger
Juice man, piff man with the grams man
Me and fam, I'm spitting bars like a jail cell

[Hook:]
Unsigned and independent
Look tell my moms I did it
When you risk your life constant struggle to survive
Yeah yeah oh woah
Unsigned and independent
I move a mile a minute
When you risk your life, constant struggle to survive
Say yeah oh woah
