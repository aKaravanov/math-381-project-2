[Meechy Darko:]
Love hurts, ask Courtney she killed Kurt
I do a bitch like Sid to Nancy if she cheat on me first
I'ma get the world's attention 'fore I bleed on this earth
You gon' really get the message if you play this reverse
Okay lyrical combat fatality, who wanna battle me, pick on
I'ma shatter every atom in his whole anatomy
[Erick Arc Elliott:]
So instead of me when you're stepping closer
You becoming my enemy for the penalty
My antenna's up sipping a Hennessy

Okay, Christmas list a bad bitch and some better weed
Amd new Desert Es, 911 with the cherry seats
Drunk driving, doing 90 down the tunnel
Desert Eagle gun on my hip, bumping Capital Punishment
[Erick Arc Elliott:]
Just watch and observe the turbulence from the wordsmith
You're hardly worth it and it urks me, what's the purpose?
From the surface I emerge without immersin'
Mama nurse me, unemployed but not thirsty
[Meechy Darko:]
Fresh out of the box, nina a virgin
Bout to pop a cherry and leave spots on your jersey
Bitches call me 2Cup Shakur, Hennessy pour
Weapons you drawing my integrity on
The thin line between love and hate, kill you
Smoke a blunt at your wake, see you in hell at the gates
My sweater shredded like Freddy but that's the way that it's made
Zombie gang, get the fuck out my face, the fuck is you say?

[Erick Arc Elliott (Meechy Darko):]
Y'all play bang-bang
This a army run up on you (bang, bang)
Insufficient when I get you
Even keep the pistol on you
Hit the call, listen my dawg
I'ma made official on
Your name brand, God damn
Whole thing glisten on you

Y'all play bang-bang
This a army run up on you (bang, bang)
Insufficient when I get you
Even keep the pistol on you
Hit the call, listen my dawg
I'ma made official on
Your name brand, God damn
Whole thing glisten on you

[Meechy Darko (Erick Arc Elliott):]
(Armaggedon)
Never leave home without my weapon
(This song)
Who want one on one with the dead man
(Them 911 [?] Kevlar)
Whole team, whole scene, whole team dead [?]
(Anything that my trust ain't gon' sell off)
Liar tell some boy they mean belage
(Play your position, we sinners and not centers)
(We always been hot splitters we won't let the cops get us)
Speaking of cops, they shot this cop on my block
They said you know what time it is? I guess he ain't had no watch
Bitch follow, niggas watch, and the game hit the spot for the fame
Money more than a game than a watch
(Don't know why, hit the spot on your block let me dig up in your pocket)
(Let me stack up on your options, cancelling your profit)

[Zombie Juice:]
Got a problem, gotta vent
Gotta shot, gotta sin
Gotta rob, gotta spend
Is it you, is it him?
Is it us, is it them?
Wonder how we make amends
Watch how they circle the block, hate us cause of our skin

Got a problem, gotta vent
Gotta shot, gotta sin
Gotta rob, gotta spend
Is it you, is it him?
Is it us, is it them?
Wonder how we make amends
Watch how they circle the block, hate us cause of our skin
