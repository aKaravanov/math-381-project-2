[Erick Arc Elliott]
Selfish dream, self-esteem
Self-destruction off the beems
Helpless beings sowing seeds to assert the solar fiends
Though it seems shit ain't panning out but it's on the screen
Know what it means
We are being deemed as a comedy

[Zombie Juice:]
This is me, fuck you mean
Living like I'm in a dream
Visualize it unity
Divide it far as you can see
Diamonds bling while they bleed
Fighting for our future seeds
Figure where you wanna be
Choose a side and take the streets

[Nyck Caution:]
I said misunderstood
I ain't afraid to say
Missing some screws above
Don't feel okay today
I pour some liquor out
I mix the pain away
Truly I do me well
It may not seem that way
I said misunderstood
I ain't afraid to say
Missing some screws above
Don't feel okay today
I pour some liquor out
I mix the pain away
Truly I do me well
It may not seem that way

[Erick Arc Elliott:]
It Archimedes [?] ingredients while I'm tedious
Mischievous the true elite convenient
Placing books where your TV is
Alleged genius proceed to flee with hits
I'm leaving this
A form of preemie fetus kid, I'm devious

[Zombie Juice:]
Processed by the media
This ain't no Wikipedia
Foods lacking substance
And people change for the greedier
Selfish and feeble
Weak minds blinded by ego and pride
Hope we can see with three eyes
Because we need to see why

[Nyck Caution:]
I said misunderstood
I ain't afraid to say
Missing some screws above
Don't feel okay today
I pour some liquor out
I mix the pain away
Truly I do me well
It may not seem that way
I said misunderstood
I ain't afraid to say
Missing some screws above
Don't feel okay today
I pour some liquor out
I mix the pain away
Truly I do me well
It may not seem that way
