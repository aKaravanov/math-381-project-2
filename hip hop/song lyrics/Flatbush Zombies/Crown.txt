[Portugal. The Man:]
I've been blooming and doom in so long
I don't think I can carry on now
This long and winding road now
Can't you see that doom's been looming too long
But I don't doubt we can stick it out
So when you hold me, hold me closer
Said that it's the head that wears the crown

[Erick Arc Eliott:]
Bleedin' through people to see these stars
I'm needed in cities, large
Look down, tote out
Break down these walls
A stupid man could evolve
Losers told me I wouldn't be on the Earth for this long
My resurgnace was strong
What do I do this for?
Gotta relieve, gotta release everything beautiful
My fabric needs, kiss my knees
Money don't suit us all
Ain't nobody perfect anyway
Mama poured a glass of minute-maid
Rid me from the evils thataway
The ones I gotta say

[Portugal, The Man:]
We just started the motion
We can't let it go back to emotions
Just a drop in the ocean
A crown of thorns in the city of roses, yeah
But it feels so right
And it feels so right

[Zombie Juice:]
Real music's still with it
Fake niggas don't get up
Just a message to myself
Mirror, mirror on the wall
This the art, put your cup
Meechie Dark, just go up
This my destiny written on the wall
Played my part
Real music's still with it
Fake niggas don't get up
Just a message to myself
Mirror, mirror on the wall
This the art, put your cup
Meechie Dark, just go up
This my destiny written on the wall
Played my part

[Meechy Darko:]
No one gets out alive
So we live like we already died
No one will ever understand but the sky
Sometimes it's just hard to focus with these voices inside the mind
I'm a demon to some
I'm a angel to others
Gotta die for what you love
Or love until it kills you
Don't be the type to talk about shit and not live it
I manifested every single one of my inventions
So I only blame myself when I don't make it to the finish
Please don't let this perception become your reflection
Uh, but excuse my aggression
'Cause my tribe called for questions
If I'm made in God's image
Tell me why am I blemished
Simple question, huh
Quite perplexin'
Them snakes will say they love you but hate you, that's type deceptive
My voice will control substance and justice
Might fuck around and fail your drug test, meth lab

Real music's still with it
Fake niggas don't get up
Just a message to myself
Mirror, mirror on the wall
This the art, put your cup
Meechie Dark, just go off
This my destiny written on the wall
Played my part
Real music's still with it
Fake niggas don't get up
Just a message to myself
Mirror, mirror on the wall
This the art, put your cup
Meechie Dark, just go up
