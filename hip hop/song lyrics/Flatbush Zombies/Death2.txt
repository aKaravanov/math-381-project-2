[Intro: Charles Manson]
Maybe I should have killed 4-500 people then I would've felt better, then I would've felt like I really offered society something you know. If I wanted to kill somebody I'd take this book and beat you to death with it, and I wouldn't feel a thing, It'd be just like walking through the drugstore.

[Verse: Meechy Darko]
I crack your fucking skully, use it as a bowl for cereal
I'm so serial, Ted Bundy give me money
Son of Sam, gun in hand, Jeffrey Dahmer with two Llamas
In a tent and that's your van
Looking for a Whatchamacallit
Too much pride, to beg your pardon
So I slaughter when I'm on you
Ginsu soldier, let me see your guts and glory
We shall possess your soul and make you off your mother like Man Ana's Brothers
I am wicked like no other, fuck you want
Zodiac killer, Libras in the trunk
Smelling like a dozen skunks
Cement their toes before I dunk them in the Hudson
Shatter jaws and break their teeth so forensics can't see nothing
Laugh as I flee the scene, and make it 500 feet
Police pull over the vee
Asked "Is that blood on my shirt?"
Said "Nah, it's a pizza stain"
We laughed, gave me a ticket
Said "nigga don't speed again"
But he wasn't black, so you know I had to aim and bang, bang, bang...
