[Intro]

[Verse 1: Juice]
(Zombie juice)
Spitting shit disfigured like ligaments
Picture the making of this my hands tied
Watch the smoke flow by by by by
On the porch Newports packs of the loud
New bitch packing the crowds
The mackin' spectacular is you fucking on nothing
Mmmmmm a little sumchin
Bitch you know I'm buzzing bumpity bumping
Packs in the back of Mach's truck n trunking
We up yet we slumping, Zombie fully function
Fu-fu-fuck corruption, lies vivid as Jenna's titties
Terrorist experiments, America's full of shit, uh
Blinded by skin color, blinded by his lover
Blinded by shining lights, and you the gift of life
Relax my mind 'til it's, do or die
Each moments a mineral, poetry's protein
The verse is a vitamin effects like codeine

[Hook:]
What ya gonna do when them zombies come for you
(Murder murder murder, kill kill kill)

(Meechy Darko)

[Verse 2: Meech]
DTA I don't trust none of my homies
Juice laced my spliff with PCP and never told me
Passed me a cup of bleach said Meech sip on this codeine
Wash it down with OE now I'm throwed up like OGs
My voice hold the beat down it's the anchor
And my nigga stay with the metal like Kurt Angle
Zombies blowing up like the Boston marathon BOOM
War too soon, opposite of late bloom
Dumped from the free throwin's, I was spewed from the womb
Survival of the fittest I ate my twin in the womb
And due to robbin' givings I may never jump the broom
And while you pay for pussy I was out in paid dues
Stage diving turned a couple thousand people to my pool
You a fool if you think I ain't on the move
I am it, I am new, I exude
But can I be reproduced as acute for my Grammy and my destitute?

[Hook]

(The Architect)

[Verse 3: Erick]
Spit in your face at the pearly gates
At 24 a nigga special like he 38
The limerick I kick is four finger ring
Shit I twist a mother fucker limbs up like a green spliff
Defying arts, no façade man my city like ahhh
So if this street on heat I'm never tryna be a boss
Rap induced have 'em used
When I scribe thought, quiet man
So if I can't stand then I'm gonna fall
I'd rather be a failure than never mentioned at all
The dimensions of the mind measure crime like yellow tape
Music the bass, swap my heart for an 808
You outta shape smoking great good God, like jay oh
Nostrils fill with the potency of smoking kief
All the windows down so you know it's me
Bow down My radiator hits like my Amy Wine Vinyl, For Now

[Hook]
