Fill the tank with gasoline
One match to burn these chains with ease
I feel so tired of the lights
Fill the tank with gasoline
One match to burn these chains with ease

[Zombie Juice:]
It's like we stuck in a prison
Suffering from lack of wisdom
Suffering from lack of substance
The systems lacking some ism
Since it's killing the misery
Hope my children remember me
Since I sing songs of symphony
Somethings just gotten into me
Message don't kill the messenger
Message travel through seven seas
Ghetto passion is classic been getting lashes for centuries
Aided by mostly separated by color deficiency
Free to you free the shackles my mental strain from my ancestry

I feel so tired of the lights
Fill the tank with gasoline
One match to burn these chains with ease
I feel so tired of the lights
Fill the tank with gasoline
One match to burn these chains with ease

Emancipation, castration, mass-hating, white washing
Black shaving patience, that I'm demonstrating, ugh
Segregation, separation, take my people, chain my people, ship them out, build a nation, picket lines, demonstration
Kill switch, detonation, this takes dedication
Guess that? our reparation governmental medication
The reverse of levitation, they put fluoride in our water
Guess they trying to kill our babies
Hearts racing, cops and robbers car chasing

I feel so tired of the lights

One match to burn these chains with ease
I feel so tired of the lights
Fill the tank with gasoline
One match to burn these chains with ease

Whatever your purpose is
Hone in and hold your kids
All of this is distractions and nobody notice it
? for knowledge we still in chains
Power tripping for digits we growing it every day
Fighting for freakom? service with student aid
Can't afford to be sitting order pills to get paid
Taught to follow the system that institution be prison
These coppers turn me to zombie
I'm walking dead while I'm living

I feel so tired of the lights
Fill the tank with gasoline
One match to burn these chains with ease
I feel so tired of the lights
Fill the tank with gasoline
One match to burn these chains with ease

Break the Chain, Break the Chain
Why the Violence is Killing our Kids and our Brother man
Break the Chain, Break the Chain
How Police War with no Recourse and you on your way
Break the Chain, Break the Chain
Still identify with those who's have nothing still live in fear
Break the Chain, Break the Chain
Been Distracted by the Glamor but don't Question why we even here
