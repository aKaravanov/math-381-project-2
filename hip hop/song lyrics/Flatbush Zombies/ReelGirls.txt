[Erick Arc Elliot:]
You offending me
Shorty dirty talking, read her lips like Maybeline
Drop it on the floor and I got hundreds, don't embarrass me
How a nigga deckin' but he's pimping so casually
Slow sipper, bout to go gorilla with my mans and them
Riding slow cause I ain't in the mood for all the rambling
Shorty game fire, bet need to call the ambulance
Woop, I got two bottles of booze, can you handle it?
Most these niggas is volunteers and I beat it like a candidate
Tippin' shorty, dip she can get the naughty hip
Pussy so delicious I can't even take my hands off her
Big ol' booty moving on me, just threw it up again
Girl you take a piece of me like I be needing up again
All these niggas jealous, they can't tell you what you up against
Now she's blowing kisses posting pictures on her social shit
Strippin' for her sisters
No positions but I open it
And it's overtime and it's over with

Okay it's Bun B, that trill OG back up in the driver seat
Whipping up that work while they Zombie boys supply the heat
Sipping 1942 and smoking on a ball bat
Posted in the VIP, stunting like we all that
Chucking up the deuce, showing love to all my kin
We standing on them tables, baby bout to get it in
If you know just like I know, you know where this is headed
A night to be remember and won't nobody forget it
Them boppers walking by showing out, tooting their ass up
Yeah I'm smoking gas baby girl but I ain't gassed up
You wanna be down, that's only if I let you
Let me marinate on it and maybe I'll come back and get you
You'r fine but your mind ain't on the level that it could be
Get down with a G and I could show you how it should be
Roll another fatty up, pass me the tequila
Let me know when you wanna make your world a little trilla
