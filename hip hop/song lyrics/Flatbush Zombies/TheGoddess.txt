I always liked the Spice Girls
Was never into nice, too-polite, clingy-type girls
You texted me them broken hearts, just say what's on your mind girl
I see them three dots, for three minutes, go ahead and type, girl
Always into weird, feared, dark-type girls
Independent, don't-need-no-nigga, keep-on-they-light girls
Don't mean to be cliché but I like girls that like girls
That like girls that like-huh
I'm into hood-type, ain't-afraid-to-fight girls
That be like, "dead-ass," or, "I put that on my life," girls
Them scam-type girls, "Take me to Barney's," straight-swipe girls
Them gang-type girls, pass-at-the-rager, see swipe girls
"I'm into philosophical," read-your-mind-type girls
That stay-woke-and-eyes-stay-low from all the-ah!
Girl you more petty than pretty, get-the-last-laugh-type girls
And, hey, I'm in your city, what you doin' tonight, girls?

[Dave B:]
Make sure the blind on the windows is closed
I swear you only hit me after my shows
What I fall into, it's the God in you
I could drown in your holy water (oooh)
I'm only here for one night so who knows
It's that time all the homies, them chose
What I fall into, it's the God in you
I could drown in your holy water (oooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I could drown in your holy water (oooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I could drown in your holy water (oooh)

[Erick:]
I wanted to rekindle this flame
Man the rainstorm
Water her flower while making this moment ours
This combination exceeds the limitations
In all of our conversations, should validate
Love is sacred
Beauty not cosmetical
Manufacture the static [?], it's magical when you get it
Most'll love to forget it
[?]
Our future together heaven
However, love is all the things that ties the severe
Knowing this union that formed between us is the same
Reason your parents connected that time at the party
As so-and-so's
Imagine all of this over Bacardi and Moet, bro
I'll be the heroic, she rollin' up something potent, though
And now she wanna hold my hand and shit
I ain't into that, but dawg I can manage it
Used to make me sick or sit [?], now you make me sandwiches
I'm in this world without a girl will make a man forget
How could I forget

[Dave B:]
Make sure the blind on the windows is closed

It's that time all the homies, them chose
What I fall into, it's the God in you
I could drown in your holy water (oooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I could drown in your holy water (oooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I could drown in your holy water (oooh)

[Meechy Darko (Erick the Architect):]
Fuck with me, I'm a big deal
Before we fuck, I strut to that pussy like Rick Flair
(Girl fuck with me, I'm a big deal)
(Take you to Benny Handa's and leave a tip for the meal)
Girl fuck with me, I'm a big deal
I'll show you ecstasy's real
Only on no ecstasy pill
(Girl fuck with me, I'm a big deal)
(Drinking that blue with you, so baby let's just chill)
