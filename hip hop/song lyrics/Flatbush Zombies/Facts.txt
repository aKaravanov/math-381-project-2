Any motherfucker with a gun ain't a mobster (Facts)
Every chick with an ass ain't poppin' (More Facts)
Every beat with a 808 ain't knockin' (Facts)
Bring it back, please rewind it
Every rapper with a platinum plaque ain't a problem (Facts)
Every nigga flippin' packs ain't a hustler (More Facts)
Everybody bought 'cause profit ain't always progress (Facts)
Bring it back, please rewind this

I'm a walkin', talkin' silhouette, the darkest rhymer
Since DMX dropped that album with blood all over his body
Haters talk shit but I don't hear or mind 'em
'Cause all that foul play gon' lead to check when I find 'em
Your girls be like, "Choke me, daddy I'm a freak"
Next week she pop up with all type of hospital fees, you know me
Shootin' until I get a trophy, been smokin' this potent, I coughed up an organ
And you wastin' your pussy if you ain't let us all in
Fuck your contract, bitch I'm breakin' all the clauses
Acid God, man I got everybody on it
Every verse a horror scene, Raptrick Bateman Vorhees
Remember me? Boosie on the side, Tunechi on top
Gold fangs, now everybody look like me, ha
What you geekin', fuck you tweakin', I ain't ever lost bitch
Only time you kill shit when you pay for abortions

Any motherfucker with a gun ain't a mobster (Facts)
Every chick with an ass ain't poppin' (More Facts)
Every beat with a 808 ain't knockin' (Facts)
Bring it back, please rewind it
Every rapper with a platinum plaque ain't a problem (Facts)
Every nigga flippin' packs ain't a hustler (More Facts)
Everybody bought 'cause profit ain't always progress (Facts)

You appear to be more than you are
How you expect me to think your jewelry is real, it costs more than your car
All this Rollie shit is all a facade
You the ace in your hood, you on the red carpet fallin' apart
Damn, I ain't never heard of it
How you receivin' rewards for a song where you ain't write a single word of it?
And the tempo don't matter, I'ma murder it (naw)
Any obstacle I'ma hurdle it (yeah, yeah)
Sound effects and mumbling', to obtain success is to be humblin'
And if you don't understand that means you one of them
Until they get it, I'ma continue to punish them
Hope you heard us, don't compare us (naw)
To the large percentage of smoke and mirrors (everybody)
I'ma leave it like that 'cause everything I said in the verse was all facts

All these new wave niggas lyin' when they rappin'
When they really just be talkin' bout some shit that never happens
Same niggas rappin' 'bout same whips, same fashion
And bitches trying to get real love with fake asses
Face assets, mind and your body gotta equal
The rule over second not to get side tracked
You figured, I mentioned the last chick I had super bad
But she burned me (Facts), thank God it wasn't herpes
Lazy bitches screaming "Where the surgeons at?"
Now black girls off white like Virgil's brand
Got these fake gang bang niggas on the 'Gram snitchin' on themself via cam
But excuse me, I think Juice laced my weed again
I don't trust nobody, no not even (myself!)
That's why I keep a condom on my dick before I leave the (crib!)
You can't buy your bitch's love, boy there's always bigger (shrimp!)
If she with you 'cause you fuck, she gon' find some better (dick!)
Bitch it's party, party, party like the spring breaker (flick!)
See your booty on the 'Gram and never pictures with your (kids!)
Why his uniform so dirty and his Timbs is scuffed to (shit!)
Meanwhile you on vacation and every weekend is (lit!)
Niggas buy jewelry, buy Jordans, buy Beamer, buy Rover
Buy Rolex, buy Gucci (Facts), buy Louis, but you can't buy culture (More Facts!)
Nigga not my culture, duck down, we see them vultures
