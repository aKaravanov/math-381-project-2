[Intro: x3]
Yeah Yeah
Zombie Zombie

[Refrain: x2]
Niggas know the timing
Nig-nig-niggas know the timing
Flow is like drugs and you rub it in your gums

Flow is like drugs and you rub it in your gums
Flow is like drugs and you rub it in your gums

[Verse 1: Meechy Darko]
Hip-hop dead, that's cause we here
Blood hound, I don't see fear
Cause I smell it, name a nigga better
And his head gets severed
Inhale pain, exhale vendetta
Smoke like I got three lungs or better
I'm in Navajo print and my bitch in leopard
She ain't really my bitch but, shhh, don't tell her
Shit get hectic
I want brain, give me brain
Wash down pain with champagne
Sour diesel hydroplane
Walking dead, zombie gang
How you gunna kill Meech
He already dead
Oh yeah that's a tip bitch, aim for the head
Only Child Syndrome, lone wolf warrior
Psychedelic renegade
Nigga we the glorious

[Refrain x2]

[Verse 2: Zombie Juice]
Hey it's Juice mane, riding through the hood
Swagger on dank, ha, remind me why I should
Respect these rap niggas, most of them are liars
They just fans man, they ain't bout that life
Bout it, bout it, bout it
Rowdy Piper, D.C. sniper
We ain't like ya, Zombie brain

I need brain, I'm insane from the crane
Sip ah drank zip ah dank 6 pac of the coor
Jigga never lied, numbers over all
A few grams of coke know that bitch off the wall
Bitch I'm high, fuck you on

[Outro:]
Niggas know the timing
Nig-nig-niggas know the timing
