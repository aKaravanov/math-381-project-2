[Verse 1: Meechy Darko]
Money can't buy happiness, dummy, it is happiness
Trap house, got work in them kitchen cabinets
Weed in them tablets, codeine and aspirin
Basking in the ambience while I'm on the Ambien
Collider pins, gold mouth Meechy, million dollar grin
Mescaline, psychedelic, failing with the sentencing
For beating up the beat, and his tongue be his weaponry
Good aim, I'll blow a nigga's brain, J.F. Kennedy
Mind frame on the damn back seat of his Bentley
I'm hard to tame, that's why I'm in leopard print every day
You ain't 'bout that life, so it's best you never try, dog
I ain't scared of death, that's 'cause I already died, dog
Blood still wet, cut the check and count them pies, dog
Motherfuck the Feds, dirty money we divide, dog
Blood still wet, cut the check and count them pies, dog
Freaky bitch with me, man - she'll probably lick my eyeballs

[Hook:]
Inf beams - you know, guns with the lazers
Couldn't afford a silencer, so we use a potato
Inf beams - you know, guns with the lazers
Couldn't afford a silencer, so we use a potato
Inf beams - you know, guns with the lazers
Couldn't afford a silencer, so we use a potato
Inf beams - you know, guns with the lazers
Couldn't afford a silencer, so we use a potato

[Verse 2: Zombie Juice]
Smokin' GDP, mixed with some Chocolope
Hash in the bowl, that super-duper stinky flow
Juicy be the name, gettin' brain, that's a zombie's fault
Flatbush nigga, Walking Dead, that's a killer flow
Smith & Wesson, catchin' wreck in your confession
Want the safe, and the stash, and the ma'fuckin' weapons
Too much Hen, now Juice is goin' in
Off tops, fuck cops, we hot, you not
That's why they honoring
I've only been around for a second, but I'm killin' it
Not rest for the wicked, niggas stay lifted, high-class livin'
Put the biscuit straight to your bitch lips
She gon' kiss it, I am pimpin'
My.44's my bulldog - my dog shoots niggas' ears off
My full mask and my AK - tear a nigga out his Chevrolet
My terrier's my.22, just for the litte-ass bitch in you
Two shots for my niggas on the block
Said he feelin' myself, and I ain't gotta see 'em hot
Outlaw, bumpin' Tupac...
Outlaw, bumpin' Tupac...

[Outro:]
I am the one to follow, I am the role model
All my tips is hollow, all my clips extended
All my whips is polished, all my teeth is gold
All my bitches models
All in all I'm all for the onslaught of all of y'all
So all aboard everyone
Awful that I must perform a Holocaust
And offer off the souls of those to get a simple point across
A cross cannot deport ya from the torture or this scorcher
You will not refuse this offer
Sign the dotted line with blood, you will not refuse this offer
Sign the dotted line with blood, you will not refuse this offer
