[Hook x2: Zombie Juice]
Got some weed, roll it up
Got some danks, roll it up
Got some drank, pour it up
LSD you know what's up
High as hell, don't give a fuck [x3]
No coming down I'm going up

[Verse 1: Zombie Juice]
In the middle of your town with a pack of that stuff
Ain't from your town but I'm chopping it up
Just one phone call finna get you niggas stuck
Her pussy so good make a nigga want to floss it
You in the same lane, bitch I'm swerving getting nauseous
Niggas trying to shoot, but they bounce right off me
Flatbush junction my hood you can't fuck with
Fresh off the boat like this bomb ass ye
My team finna blow, shout out to the game
Badman, ain't got no words
I ain't trying to flex but if you say my name again
And you saw mothafucker I be praying for my enemies
Grab a bottle henny smoke a 50 simple chemistry
Down for the cause bitch I'm riding till the end of me
Down goes the ball, head off no feeling it.

[Hook: Zombie Juice]

[Verse 2: Zombie Juice]
I'm in love with the mic, engulfed in the life
All these wack ass rappers spitting all for the ice
Money can't buy swag
Funny nigga you a dummy
Money can drop fast
If you can't count sunny aw shit with the sleekness
27 cause woke up the next day made 20 grand more
Fucking with the zombies like Tyson to a jaw
I'm a high mothafucker come and box with the law
