[Verse 1: Meechy Darko]
Today I purchased a coffin and I ain't even died yet
Smoked about 100 blunts and I ain't even high yet
Wrote my verse in poison ink, watch you biters digest
Got the illest grind yet? No, eye can deny it
Lungs full of uhh, Eye bloody red nigga
Gold fangs on uhh, pocket full of dead niggas
Smoke some bitch, what the fuck you waitin on?
I know it's a virtue, but baby my patience is gone
Get our relation on, take her to a vacant home
What you want a quicky sticky? Okay I won't takey long
Split the dutch down the middle like Moses, split the sea
Count it up, bag it up man, we love money, we love weed
Met this one bimbo, told her my name was Meech
She keep calling me mandingo
My eyes bloody red, so she probably think I'm evil
Truely, it's the weed smoke from all this sour deisel
Light it then I breathe slow

[Hook: x2]
Seaweed flow, must be from that weed smoke
Eyes Chinese, cause we smoking sour diesel
Blunts Siamese, two of these, you be me yo
Fuck the police though, we smoke it like it's legal

[Verse 2: Zombie Juice]
Juicy Mr Young Bone, AK I'm so gone
Hoes love me, Jerome, hoes love me, Jerome

Sit back, get smacked, get stoned
In the back of the back of the room
With the mac in the back of the room, she acting get doomed
BLAOHW, splat in the room
Women they awful, I mean they on fours
Call this my dumb flow, Urkle, Waldo
Call this my purp flow, roll up the indo
I'm here dog, whatchu here for?
Hip-hop is dead, Zombies for prez
Remindy, untimely, two blunts I'm Siamese
Pussy we grind thee, sticky and grimey, wicked unchain me
Twisted my frame be, blunt after blunt after... blunt
So stuck so stuck off the what?
Sticky, icky, quickly, vicky, lick me, no hickeys, gin and whiskey
Just me and some piffy, swiftly

[Hook x2]
