What if I知 never famous?
What if, I知 broke
And my whole life been a joke?
What if nothing never happens?
What if I gotta stop rapping?
What if, what if, what if this is it?

What if I never get the chance to tell the world what I gotta say?
When I die all I do is just ride away
I tried to talk about my life in every song
So you have a little something to remember when I知 gone.
I tell it like it is, I ain稚 pretending that I'm on
But I tell you that I知 working and I知 getting very strong
It won稚 be long till you hear me on the radio
But in my head I got ways to go
But I'mma take it slow, this is the way to blow
So any place I go, I know my bank can row
The old heads are schooling me I知 taking notes, I am hip hop
It replaces my soul if I sink to the bottom then I'mma make a float.
I heard the real world痴 cold, I知ma take a coat
Be prepared, and be aware cause failure ain't really even there

What if I値l never make it?
What if I知 never famous?
What if, I知 broke
And my whole life been a joke?
What if nothing never happens?
What if I gotta stop rapping?
What if, what if, what if this is it?

Expectations peeking, they wonder what I知 about to do
Spark interest, music I can count on you, right? 
Or do I have it all twisted? I went from popular to misfit in an instant
My friends forgot me cause they probably seen me hardly
In the lab when I should be out at a party
It drives me crazy, money is the fuel
Insomniac, awake finding something I can do to put the work in and
I'm certain that I'm flirting with the fame
Failure getting jealous, throwing dirt upon my name
Burning up my brain, but I知 working through my pain
Cause life痴 hard, till you learn it痴 just a game
Play your cards, use your letters on your scrabble board
If you池e smart, put your heart into your rapping more
No money? why the fuck you池e counting for?
A thousand tours trying to get up my allowance more

What if I値l never make it?

And my whole life been a joke?
What if nothing never happens?
