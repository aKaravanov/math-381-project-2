Oh, Hi!
Welcome back to K.I.D.S. uhm…..
Follow your dreams?...
Yeah!

I wanna get a mansion, a jacuzzi
A theater to watch my movies
A couple whips and lots of fancy things
The kids they call the Goonies
See the future, crystal ball
Mirror, mirror hangin' on the wall
Who the flyest white boy of them all?
Got your girlfriend screenin' all the calls

She Bubblin', we fuckin' then you cuddlin'
Like baby where the fuck you been?
Don't wanna tell you she in love with him
So! so! we ain't sayin' nothin'
You could probably tell she bluffin'
Cause she kiss you with the mouth
She gave me head with my concussion

Yeah she blushin', all red
Wanna rush and go to bed
You interrogate that bitch like you the Feds
So she says, she in love with a rockstar, rockstar
Wanna smoke my weed, so she asks me where the tops are, tops are

Oh, oh, oh
Honey I need you 'round
I know, I know

Just some mothafuckin Kids!

Oh
Oh
Oh! Get money fuck bitch
Only I need You!
Fly
I know - Yeah!
I know - Pittsburgh!

Hey Jerm…! Hey
These hoes is drunk, wanna come and smoke this blunt
Then let me take 'em home and do anything I want
I say: "Baby I can ride ya, just let me get inside ya
I can take you higher if you hit this vaporizer"
I got that dope dick, I'll be your supplier
You grabbin' on my sheets and hittin' notes like you Mariah
Obsessed with me; wanna dress a freak on ecstasy
I'm out and then she textin' me
Like: "What you doin' next week, next week?"

Hear me now
I'm down on knees and praying
Though my faith is weak
Without you so please baby please
Give us a chance
Make amends and I will stand up till the end
A million times, a trillion times

Ohh!
Ohhh! - (Swooo Inhale)
Ohhh! - (Kids (Kids) What Up!)
Honey I need you 'round! - (I'm high as fuck)
 (Yessir)
I know- I Graduated
I know- Oh yeah I just Graduated High school! AHAA!

Hey Homie!
Don't be mad that your girl loves me
It's not my fault
I'm just doin me
The girl love me let her love me
Ya feel me?

So baby
Smile
Baby don't cry
I want you to fly
You by my side
