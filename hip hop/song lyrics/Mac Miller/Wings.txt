Look

I got a bone to pick like roses (roses)
I ain't feelin' broken no more
Brought a fist that got spent, I notice
Talkin' shit, I went thorugh the motives
Wonder who the fuck I'm supposed to be
I ain't worried now 'til I leave
I'm just tryna ride, feel the breeze
There's something bad beside next to me
Wind in my face, don't stop now when it feels so great
You can run 'til you slip on the sidewalk
And the same bone you picked on break, that's a motif (that's a motif)
Yeah, when it's comin' right back, so familiar, never been realer
Never felt so damn good where I'm at
I don't know what it's all about, runnin' through many dots to count
Still ain't addin' up, let you know that I've had enough, yeah
Yeah

I put some money on forever, but I (hey)
Don't like to gamble on the weather, so I, just, watch, well
The sun is shinin', I can look at the horizon
The walls keep gettin' wider, I just hope I never find 'em, I know
Hey

These are my wings, these are my wings, yeah
These are my wings, yeah, well

Movin' so fast, the clock look slow (slow)
Water my seeds 'til the flower grow, yeah
Love so much that my heart get broke
I don't really know how the normal shit go, so
I guess I just play it by ear, silence is all that I hear
Listenin' close as I can, growin' up (123) jump
Nobody holdin' my hand, no
Trust is a problem, never know how, yeah
That's why I just keep to myself
Get what I need, then I'll be out (please help me)
Come observe the universe with me
Lucifer is human and so are we
All I ever want is what I need
And I don't include your time and company
Follow me, we on up and up
Remember when I owed a hundred bucks
Now, we look around like what the fuck?
If you don't fuck with me, you fuckin' up

I know I need to watch my temper, so I
Know never gamble on the weather but I, just, watch, well, look
The sun is shinin', I can look at the horizon
The walls keep gettin' wider, I just hope I never find 'em, no, no
Hey, well

These are my wings, these are my wings
These are my wings
