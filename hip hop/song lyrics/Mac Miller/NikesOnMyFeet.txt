Aye lace 'em up, lace 'em up, lace 'em up, lace 'em
Blue suede shoes stay crispy like bacon.
Nikes on my feet make my cypher complete,
Uh I stay shining like the lights on the street in the night.

Revis take me shopping when I'm up in New York
Hit the shoe store go and cop a few more
You at the mall getting dinner at the food court
I'm at LA eating 22 course

Young boss bitch paper in my pockets
I got a closet filled with shoe boxes
Mom say my spending habit a little bit obnoxious
But a pilot stay fresh up in his cockpit

Used to rock hand-me-downs
Now I buy some clothes wear 'em out,
Hit the club bitches pull they cameras out.
Living in a dream they beginning to believe
My hotel smell like cigarettes and weed.
Shit,

With what I'm spitting they should give me a degree
Good liquor what I'm sipping isn't cheap uh
Finna blow don't snooze don't sleep
All I really need is some shoes on my feet

I make 'em so mad, they got no swag
Pippins on my feet they the throw-backs
Look, my money good but these hoes bad
So they stay attached to my gonads uh

Waking up to a few Ls
Open up my closet to that new-shoe smell
I guess I'm doing well
Smoking all the weed that I used to sell

But once my album goes in the shelves
It's going Nextel how it's finna sell
For now we're selling tapes out my shoe box
Any spot just set up my shop

You're mad that your girl always says that I'm hot
She buy my T-shirts but she's spending your guap
Say "What's up?" if you see me around
Nike Airs separate my feet from the ground it's just

And the Nikes on my feet keep my cypher complete
Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nikes
