[Johnny Venus:]
Sleeping flow to flow with the angels
Door to door like Khroma
Hit ya door with that Kramer
All shaky and angry
Watch ya step
Head to toe, head to toe

I know the money won't change us
I ain't change my face in at least 'bout 8 months
I ain't change my skin in at least 'bout 8 suns
Same socks from that day one run
The problem is that you never play with lingo, son
Let that sink in like that lake or sumin'
You just made 50 grand in a day or sumin'
We can't bring 'em back but it's gon' be okay, pour some
Anybody case til my face go numb
Bitch, this beat got the whole place all dumb
And I'm just tryna see where I can place both thumbs
I got a legacy to keep, I got the K-0 sumin'
I got the strap, I gotta eat, I got some beamers to defeat
Like great grandma Shelton
Like it's just me against myself and I gotta slay [?]

[Jordxn Bryant:]
When I'm high I feel my wings
Clip them shits if my soul's is in your view
Feeling sober in a pool of Hen and Cola breaking rules
Like "that's ya girl? ", I hit her too
Love just how that figure move
Figure you just run and pass and so that's why I stuck and move
Premonitions from the texts she sent me
My homie told me she a queen, but guillotine was the net, left me empty
Underestimated- the texts she sent me
From then on, I acted extra friendly
All I got is time to waste
Spill the liquor on the time x face
Trip a nigga if I'm tryna chase
Trampoline dreams get me high today
Feel me or kill me, but I'm tryna say:
Nigga, I spill

[Doctur Dot:]
Look in the mirror [?] wealth
Cause I love drugs too much to even try to sell
I guess I love up too much for all this right and left
But I fucked up so much, it's only writing left
Right at the bottom left corner of the city
Where the red clay master read bones of the richest dances you know
Could be the North Pole just put this glass to your nose
Breathe deep and stick a rapper (wrapper) in the back of your throat
Baby girl, if you ain't certain, you should probably reconsider
Reconnecting with the nigga, You was fucking 'fore I hit it
I'm a hazard, I'm a master, I'm a slave, I'm a sickness
I'm a blunt away from tunnelling with spoons to free you niggas
Pussy is my favorite vice and my vulnerability is limited
To the records I've written in, to the bitches I'm smiting with
Death of a little brother can turn you into a kid again
He's in a better place, the toe tag was just the ticket in
