[Faith Evans:]
I found a friend who is all to me
His love, is ever true, so true
I love to tell how he lifted me
And from his grace, came through for you

I'm saved by his power, divine
I'm saved by new light, sublime
Life now is sweet and my joy is complete
For I'm saved, saved, saved
[x4]

Hey you, my joy
Sing it yo

[Bereal Family:]
(Life now is sweet and my joy is complete...)
(Saved, saved, saved, oh yes, I'm saved...)

[Faith Evans:]
You know that I've been through, whole lotta things in my life
But I know that my god, my god, my god, my god
He gives me joy
My life's complete
Can't nobody do it like him
No, no, no, no, no he's my
Everything, everything, everything
My life... yeah...
Cause I'm saved, yeah
Oh my god
Yes, he saved me
Heaven saved for his grace
And his power, and his mercy
I'm saved... oh yeah...
