[Snoop Dogg:]
I got 25 ways I can get it
And 20 home boys that's fully with it
It's only gon' take 'bout 30 minutes
From the effects that you feel from the bag of spinach
It's vintage, authentic, I have no limits
C Walk in the party let the Crips up in it
To handle our business, baby, put your back up in it
CB, OT, yeah we back up in it
The west coast do the most
Take a drag out the dope
House party like a motherfucker full of my folks
He a dog, and a couple of P's
Pile of seeds, weed, and a couple of G's
Ooh wee, I got the mic, it's my turn
The roof is on fire, let that motherfucker burn
We don't need no water if your daughter is hot
Just send her to the Dogg so I can woop-de-wop

[Chris Brown:]
Sexy girl you came to party
You and your girlfriends
3's company
Girl, I don't mind, fun time
Oh baby, let me see you walk
Step to me
Then sway when you shake that booty (oh yeah)
Hit your walk, hop to it
I'ma show you the way a real player do it

[O.T. Genasis:]
Skip, Skip, Skip, Skip, Skip
I'm a long beach nigga, long beach Crip
See her at the party, big thang on her hip
Gun never tiny, you can kiss this tip (muah!)
Handle, got that stick like magic
Never drink it straight, where the Kool-Aid?
Leave a nigga bloody like bootleg
I'm a northside nigga, stand on my toes
Cisco nigga, staying on the hoes
I heard she a flip, ran off her clothes
Threw her in the air, landed on the bros
O.T., SD, CB
Any nigga say some gotta see me
36 O's, pair of phones
Double M give it up, chunky

I ain't tryna knock your hustle, babe
You know I'm a dog, but there's no petting
More fire, more loud, we all can blaze
You lookin' like twins, both hands, two bodies
One I'm in the sheets, other one her knees (sheets)
Mary Jane's a freak, and I love Molly
I'm tryna paint two Mona Lisa
One black, one white, at the same time
Them strobe lights keep flashing
It's just me and you two in this room
And it feels like déjà vu
Like I been here with you two, before
