[Gunshot]
La la la la la
We don't give a fuck
Ayy y'all niggas ain't fucking with us, nigga
La la la la la
Imma get it like this nigga

[Redman:]
Yo I got the green, Don Juan
I'm in the hood, blow the horn, bom-bom
This pimpin' ain't for free, here's a coupon
My backwoods packs I turn to a futon
I got my eyes on seven figures
And I'mma get it whether I move crooked like Jack Thriller's
I'm shittin' on em, I smell like a winner
Don't hit the bathroom for like forty-forty-five minutes
Redman and we up in this bitch, huh
I never cruise, I work to be the top gun
And I'm a dog off the collar, the marijuana globe trotters
You's got bud, I holler

Ayo this one nigga that roll up that smoke
When I hit the weed spot, my pockets go broke
We high, we high, we high, we high (say it again)
Ayo this one nigga that roll up that smoke
When I hit the weed spot, my pockets go broke
We high, we high, we high, we high (say it again)

[B-Real:]
It's the four horsemen
Call for reinforcements
We ain't looking for endorsements
We absorb your portions

[Method Man:]
I ain't here to bring the East back (nah), I'm here to relapse
And now I'm outta rehab they ask me where the weed at
Go get a weed app (homie), I got that weed that have your P.O getting P.O, ask me where to pee at
My G, pack the streets of New York, I give em G-Rap
I'm kool, on the road to riches to get my G back
I'll be that, killer bees mind your beeswax
Past 10 o'clock when ya still don't know where your seat at
Ask big Snoop, it don't take a Crip to see that
Be real, what you read about Meth Man, believe that
I'm nice, I gots no chill, go get a ski hat
In fact, put ya twitter on ice, chill with the feedback

[Snoop Dogg:]
From the days of Cheech and Chong, to Willie Nelson
Everywhere that I go, I blow fo sho, you smelled it
A lot of y'all fuckin' with me, sayin' I'm on your bucket list
But I ain't the one to be fuckin' with
See, I'm like a quick game of tic-tac-toe, take three in a row
Aye lil nigga, go'n hit that door
I'm back with my niggas Earth wind, no snow
And I got the fire on Mt. Kushmore
So let it rain like the leaves of a cannabis plant
When I say it, I mean it as a matter of fact
Well I outta, slip mo dick in your daughter, for starters
Leafs by Snoop, may I take your order?

Ayo this one nigga that roll up that smoke
When I hit the weed spot, my pockets go broke
We high, we high, we high, we high (say it again)
Ayo this one nigga that roll up that smoke
When I hit the weed spot, my pockets go broke
We high, we high, we high, we high (say it again)
