[Rick Rock:]
I wear my heart on my sleeve, but it's a purple heart (purple heart)
North bay, water mammals, known with killer sharks (killer sharks)
I'm from the 7-O-7, it's no heaven (it's no heaven)
I'm a Top 5 Mobb, Hi-fi veteran (Hi-fi veteran)
Ricky Rock my nigga, I got slaps (got slaps)
You can play him for hours, back to back (back to back)
Niggas on your team that love that money over everything
Can never be loyal, now take that back to the soil
Anywhere on earth, and it'll work
I'm just sharing my experience I lurk for what it's worth
Maybe it's a [?] 'cause I don't trust y'all
I'm in a love, caught some grapes in a buzz ball, trippin' like
Look at this shit here (here)
This sucker shit is running rampant, it's the moment I fear

It was the moment I fear
My nigga it was the moment I fear
My nigga it was the moment I fear
My nigga it was the moment I fear

[Snoop Dogg:]
Ricky is tricky, the game is gettin' slippery
This shit is a maze, cuz singing like a Tempree
I disappear for one minute 'til they miss me
Another TV show, more dough, I'm makin' history
Now I'm back at your service
Wish me luck dear, I'm scared and I'm nervous
You never left you brought that hood back with ya
I'm the real deal, I ain't got bullshit with ya
Another one I wanna make, another joint I wanna make
Open up and put some candles on my dick
Twenty-five and countin', adds my face in the Kushmore Mountain
Can't be scared of your pony dawg, own if you want it, trip this
This sucker shit is running rampant, it's the moment I fear

[Rick Rock:]
It was the moment I fear
My nigga it was the moment I fear
My nigga it was the moment I fear
My nigga it was the moment I fear
Yeah, my nigga it was the moment I fear
My nigga it was the moment I fear
My nigga it was the moment I fear
My nigga it was the moment I fear
Yeah, my nigga it was the moment I fear
