Mama you my everything you taught me how to be this way
The devil is a lie so I'ma walk the Jesus way
He taught me how to lead so I'ma take a stand and leave the day
I thank you for everything that you've given me
More precious than jewelry and you can read it on my eulogy
Every day you pray for me to keep them demons away from me
I love you dearly, sincerely [?] love Snoop

Mama, thank you for having me
Coulda gave me up but you raised a family
I wanna thank you mama, thank you for everything
Coulda gave me up but you did it like a G

Mama, thank you for having me
Coulda gave me up but you raised a family
I wanna thank you mama, thank you for everything
Coulda gave me up but you did it like a G

What can I say, what can I do
I'll sit back and admire you
Oh what a beauty you are to me
Oh mama, this song to you I dedicate
The sacrifices that you made
And today's your special day, oh

So run it by your family and your friends
We want oyu to know you a special lady
And you are appreciated
Mama, you were always there for me
(Oh mama) Mama running on some legacy

Mama, thank you for having me
Coulda gave me up but you raised a family
I wanna thank you mama, thank you for everything
Coulda gave me up but you did it like a G

How bout a musical for the beautiful
We should do something bout the usual mom
Go pack a bag and we can hit the road mom
I know [?] get your own
Whoa, mama, all of my life you was the backbone
You taught me life, living it [?]
And you know papa was a rolling stone

(M, O, T, H, E, R) I wanna wish you happy mother's day
I hate to fight [?] way we play
Taught me, ain't nothing like the family
My sister (M, O, T, H, E, R) we wouldn't even have no birthdays
If you didn't love us in the first place
[?] music [?]
(M, O, T, H, E, R)
