[Snoop Dogg:]
A lotta times
You see performing for thousands of people
Filling their hearts with love and joy
Not knowing that I'm going through so much pain
But God knows everything
And I mean everything that I'm going through

[B Slade:]
Pain
Pain
God knows about your pain
Pain
Pain
God knows about your pain

Feeling so alone and deserted
People standing all around you
You walk around, hey
With a fake smile on your face
Cuz you don't nobody to know what you're going through, no
But your weeping may endure for a night
But your joy is coming in the morning
But you weeping may endure for a night
But your joy is coming, oh

Pain
Pain
God knows about your pain, oh
Pain
Pain
God knows all about your pain

Feeling so alone and deserted
People stand all around you
Walk around
Head up with foolish pride
Cuz you don't want nobody to know what you're going through, oh
But your weeping may endure for a night
But your joy is coming in the morning
But your weeping may endure for a night
But your joy comes in the morning

Comes in the morning
Morning, ooh yeah
It comes in the morning
[?] cause it holds me fast
Clouds in the sky, hurrying by
I know it's alright, Jesus is mine

Joy comes in the, joy comes in the...
Joy comes in the morning time
Joy!
Joy!
Joy comes in the...

Joy comes in the morning
Break it down one more time for me
But your weeping may endure for a night
But your joy comes in the morning
