You took this heart of mine
You be my valentine in the summer
In the summer
You are my only one
Just dance and having fun
Out in the shining sun of the summer
Of the summer

Do love me, do love me, do
Do love me, do love me, do
I love you
Do love me, do love me, do
Do love me, do love me, do
Put no one else above you
Do love me, do love me, do
Do love me, do love me, do
I need you
Do love me, do love me, do
Do love me, do love me, do

Do love me, do love me, do
Do love me, do love me, do
