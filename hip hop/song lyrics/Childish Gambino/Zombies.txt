[Childish Gambino:]
All I see is zombies
Walking all around us
You can hear them coming (they come to take your life)
You can hear them breathing, breathing down your spine

All I see is zombies
Hear them screaming at her
They can smell your money
And they want your soul
Here they come behind you
Try to stay alive

[Kari Faux:]
We're coming out to get you
We're oh, so glad we met you
We're eating you for profit
There is no way to stop it

[Childish Gambino:]
You will find there is no safe place to hide
(That's right, that's right)

All I see is zombies
Feeding all around us
All they eat are people (and you won't survive)
They don't know what happened
They just stay alive

[Kari Faux:]
We're coming out to get you
We're oh, so glad we met you
We're eating you for profit
There is no way to stop it

[Childish Gambino:]
You will find there is no safe place to hide
(That's right, that's right)

[Kari Faux:]
We're coming out to get you
We're oh so glad we met you
We're eating you for profit
There is no way to stop it

[Childish Gambino:]
Do you feel alive, yeah?
Do you feel alive, yeah?
Do-do-do-do-do
Do you feel alive?
