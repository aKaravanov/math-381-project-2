I wanna leave this place like all the time
Talking to my boss, he just can't feel the dream
That's the chance to let me blow your mind

Can't take a break (and you know that's right)
Money is tight (and you know that's right)
It's on my mind
Can't break away (and you know that's right)
Money is tight (and you know that's right)
It's on my mind

When the feeling gotcha
You can't even hide it, acting so intoxicated
When you text me, "hold on"
You will be there—girl, just hold on, uh!

Saturday, all I wanna do is make you dance, girl
And all of mine
Saturday, all I wanna do is make you dance, girl
And all of mine

Ooh, aye
Give it to me now
Woo, aye
Uh, aye, aye, aye

God, this 9 to 5 just keep on killing me
Tryna leave this place like all the time
Oh, my aching bones, they just keep killing me
Can't afford to have them spend my dime, hey

When the feeling gotcha
You can't even hide it, acting so intoxicated
When you text me, "hold on"
I will be there—girl, just hold on, uh!

Saturday, all I wanna do is make you dance, girl
And all of mine
Saturday, all I wanna do is make you dance, girl
And all of mine
