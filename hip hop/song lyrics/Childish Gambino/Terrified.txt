You won't always be around
Catch a nigga coming quickly behind ya
People want you underground
Do you misbehave?
Haunt you to your grave
I'm going to eat you alive
Please don't find me rude
But I don't eat fast food
So don't run to me, baby
Uh, are not

Just hide, oh!
You know that you're the one, that's terrified, oh!
Just hide, oh!
You know that you're the one, that's terrified, oh!

I'm spinning, I'm spinning, I'm spinning you up...

Just hide, oh!
You know that you're the one, that's terrified, oh!
Just hide, oh!
You know that you're the one, that's terrified, oh!

No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Please
No, no, no, oh
Oh you can't run from me
You can't hide from me
