[Intro: Swizz Beatz]
If you got a whip outside right now (right now)
And you really about that life
Put your keys in the air right now, damn!

[Hook]
That Louie, my cologne when I’m ridin’ in that Lambo
Assault rifles in the back like Rambo
Ridin’ in that Lambo, ridin’ in that Lambo
Assault rifles in the back like Rambo
Oh my God I’m in this ho
Oh my God I’m in this ho
Oh my God I’m, oh my God I’m
Oh my God I’m in this ho
In this ho, I’m in this ho
Oh my God I’m in this ho
Oh my God I’m, oh my God I’m
Oh my God I’m in this ho (wait a minute)
That Louie my cologne when I’m ridin’ in that Lambo
Assault rifles in the back like Rambo
(Talk to ‘em Pusha)

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Woah, I’m pullin’ up in that shit (damn)
Four fifty eight on that bitch
Doors liftin’ up on that shit
Ho, you see the shit on my wrist?
Oh my God I’m in this ho, oh my God I’m in this ho
Yeah I’m fuckin’ that centerfold
Fuck you all in my business for?
You ain’t talkin’ ’bout gettin’ dough
You ain’t talkin’ ’bout gettin’ more
Lakers Heat, camera seats
That’s the difference between rich and poor
Recognize I jeopardize that top spot and they testify
They ate first and I’m next in line
We back to back and he pass baton
I point my chest at that finish line
This art money, this renaissance
My chain heavy, it’s winning time
See all colors, this Benetton

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Swizz Beatz]
Vroom, vroom, I ride around like this
Swizz, I’m back up on my shit
Haters, got to suck the dick
Agh, y’all can get them clips
I’m ridin’ ’round in that Countach
Candy paint on that Countach
White seats on that Countach
Have you ever seen a Countach?
Red farm I’m in red action
Came back I’m like Michael Jackson
Woo! Michael Jackson
Wait a minute, let me slow it down
For you dumb niggas that slower down
Damn, damn, I just crashed it
But I’m ’bout to get another one you little bastards

[Hook]
