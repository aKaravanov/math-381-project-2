It's a different jingle when you hear these car keys
Your SL's missing an "S", nigga
Your plane's missing a chef
The common theme, see, they've both got wings
If you fly, do it to death
It's only one God, and it's only one crown
So it's only one king that can stand on this mound
King Push, kingpin, overlord
Coast Gurad come, 100 goin' overboard
I got money with the best of 'em
Go blow-for-blow with any Mexican
Don't let your side bitches settle in
Might have to head, but you're Evelyn
Ballers - I put numbers on the boards
Hard to get a handle on this double-edged sword
Whether rappin' or unwrapping to a whore
Might reach back and relapse, the wrapping of this raw
Givenchy fitting like it's gym clothes
We really gym stars, I'm like D-Rose
No D League, I'm like "these close"
'88 Jordan leapin' from the free-throw
Ballers - I put numbers on the boards
Ballers - I put numbers on the boards
(Motherfuckers can't rhyme no more, 'bout crime no more)
Mix drug and show money, Biggs Burke on tour
25 bricks, move work like chore
Hit Delaware twice, needed 25 more
I see flaws, cracks in your diamonds
CB4 when you rhyme, Simple Simon
Come and meet the pie man - a must that I flaunt it
The legend grow legs when it comes back to haunt us
Ballers - I put numbers on the boards
Can't a bitch live and say I bought her Michael Kors?
Every car driven was decided by the horse
Keep the sticker in the window 'case you wonder how it cost
How could you relate when you ain't never been great?
And rely on rap money to keep food up on your plates, nigga?
I might sell a brick on my bithday
36 years of doing dirt like it's Earth Day
God!
Ballers - I put numbers on the boards
