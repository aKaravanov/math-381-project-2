[Sample From "Woods": Justin Vernon]
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a sill to slow down the time
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a sill to slow down the time
'M up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a sill to slow down the time

[Chorus: x2]
I'm lost in the World, I'm down on my mind
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
Down for the night
Said she's down for the night

[Chorus:]
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a sill to slow down the time
I'm lost in the World, I'm down on my mind
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
Down for the night
Said she's down for the night

Look at my situation, I couldn't ask for more
I'm the real Situation, I should be on Jersey Shore
Look what that kilo sent me
That Porsche is keyless entry
That girl is high and drunk I swear the rest is elementary
We found a superfreak, no, she won't know what hit her
I'm on my Rick James, minus the beads and glitter
You've got to beg my pardon, this shit here is money talking
You don't get good dick to often, I'm a have you funny walking
See that shit I pull up parking, make your neck snap the fuck off it
Damn, too late you lost it, back to that world you lost in
Back to that world you lost in

[Chorus: x2]
I'm lost in the World, I'm down on my mind
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
Down for the night
Said she's down for the night

Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?

[Chorus: x2]
I'm lost in the World, I'm down on my mind
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
Down for the night
Said she's down for the night

[Gil-Scott Heron:]
Us living as we do upside down. And the new word to have is revolution. People don't even want to hear the preacher spill or spiel because God's whole card has been thoroughly piqued. And America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey. The youngsters who were programmed to continue fucking up woke up one night digging Paul Revere and Nat Turner as the good guys. America stripped for bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes. The signs of Truth were tattooed across our open ended vagina. We learned to our amazement untold tale of scandal. Two long centuries buried in the musty vault, hosed down daily with a gagging perfume. America was a bastard the illegitimate daughter of the mother country whose legs were then spread around the world and a rapist known as freedom, free doom. Democracy, liberty, and justice were revolutionary code names that preceded the bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling in the mother country's crotch
What does Webster say about soul?
All I want is a good home and a wife
And a children and some food to feed them every night.
After all is said and done build a new route to China if they'll have you.

Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
