Then you cannot solve it
You live in the cross hass
When you want to talk it
It's hard to stay in the ground
The brighter you stuck it
From sun of the sun down
I'm glowing regardless
We came with the mission
To corner the market
To take you gotta be harmness, one of the hardest, ow!

I'll be the realest one alive, you don't want no problems
Take you down and it gon' be no problem, yeah
I get the feeling like I'm high
All my life you ain't gon' walk these problems
Take you down ain't gon' be no problem, yeah
Don't you play with God
I got the ticket of squad, coming for you
I got diamonds dancing in my mouth
Think you're the king of this house, so coming for you
I'll be the realest one alive, you don't want no problems
Take you down and it gon' be no problem, yeah

Dead or alive, I'm wanted
Just like a ghost, I'm haunted
I'm callin' the shots, you callin' the cops
The angel of death is upon us
It's not a threat, it's a promise
Killing and will if we honest
I tell you, no lie, it's tickle and high
And you like the one with the monsters
I am the power (yeah)
I got the problem (yeah)
I got the pool, I run with the bulls
You run with the cowards
There ain't no vowers, this thing is ours (yes)
I put out the heat, you funeral's lit
I showed up with flowers

I'll be the realest one alive, you don't want no problems
Take you down and it gon' be no problem, yeah
I get the feeling like I'm high
All my life you ain't gon' walk these problems
Take you down ain't gon' be no problem, yeah
Don't you play with God
I got the ticket of squad, coming for you
I got diamonds dancing in my mouth
Think you're the king of this house, so coming for you
I'll be the realest one alive, you don't want no problems
Take you down and it gon' be no problem, yeah
