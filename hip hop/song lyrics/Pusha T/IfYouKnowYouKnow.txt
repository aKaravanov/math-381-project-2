The wrist on that boy rockstar like Pink Floyd
Waving at rude boy
I'm waving at you, boy
Ran off on the plug too like Trugoy
Imagine me do, boy
You could never do what I do, boy
Still duckin' shit that I did, boy
Niggas in Paris 'fore Hit-Boy
This ain't the same type of hits, boy
Shit can get litter than lit, boy
You don't take these type of risks, boy
'Cause this boy, been throwin' that D like Rich Boy
You missed, boy
Ya numbers don't add up on the blow
That was ten years ago
If you know, you know (yeah)
If you know, you know
If you know, you know

This thing of ours, oh, this thing of ours
A fraternity of drug dealers ringing off
I just happen to be alumni
Too legit, they still looking at me with one eye
The company I keep is not corporate enough
Child rebel soldier, you ain't orphan enugh
A rapper turned trapper couldn't morph into us
But a trapper turned rapper can morph into Puff
Dance contest for the smokers
I predict snow, Al Roker
If you know, you know
I only ever looked up to Sosa
You all get a bird, this nigga Oprah

Brick layers in ball shorts
Coaching from the side of the ball court
If you know, you know
One stop like a Walmart
We got the Tennis balls for the wrong sport
If you know, you know
If you know 'bout the car port
The trap door supposed to be awkward
That's the reason we ball for
Circle around twice for the encore
If you know, you know

You ever been hit with the water weight
Then had to wait, do you war or wait?
If you know, you know
When we all clicking like Golden State
And you and your team are the motorcade
If you know, you know
Been granting wishes like a genie
Two bad hoes in two piece bikinis
I've been hiding where you can see me
The skybox is right next to RiRi's
Soley responsible for showing rappers how to stand
On the front lines when trappers started throwing bands
Where were you when Big Meech brought the tigers in?
'Cause I was busy earning stripes like a tiger's skin

Brick layers in ball shorts
Coaching from the side of the ball court
If you know, you know
One stop like a Walmart
We got the Tennis balls for the wrong sport
If you know, you know
If you know 'bout the car port
The trap door supposed to be awkward
That's the reason we ball for
Circle around twice for the encore
If you know, you know
