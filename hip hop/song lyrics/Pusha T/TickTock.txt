[Intro: Pusha T]
King Push, RZA, razor, execution

[Pusha T]
The devil is a liar, you ain't broke bread, til you taste the devil's pie
They say his laugh sounds like an angel when he cries
What better camouflage when the halo's your disguise, them wings don't fly
Your traitor is your neighbor, at your front porch
And he's handing you your paper, bathrobe on
But the swords underneath, and they wanna see your blood
As it pours in the street, it's the mark of the beast
The meek shall inherit the earth, the weak shall inherit the dirt
You each should of perished at birth, still born or aborted
Every street tax gotta come with an audit
Either your life or your loved ones, straight razor or a snub gun
From the village where the thugs from
Same corner that you copping all your drugs from
He a hero but he unsung, I'm the one

[Raekwon]
The Chambers is 36, the new and improved
Now make a move, these guns whistle, sizzle up dudes
Who got big mouths, no power, run to the bank
With no dollars, got the nerve to switch crews
We better then the rest of them, my guess is the estrogen
And all the money we got, will move like the Mexicans
And cartel, compound, and Carvel, the large scale
It's Scarsdale, I fuck with golf, now, Shallah's ill
Yeah, the coke is fresh, straight out of Bermuda, yo
I'm chilling on the beach in Boca, chica with tuna
Salads and palaces, yo, we smoke out them chalices
Passing off balances, and bread til the Island, since
Ninety eighty four, the blow is just more
Then we would come through with rifles, rocking night boots in war
A real niggas invention that came from a henchman
Who blew up, now through the Wu up, that's my redemption

[Chorus: Pusha T sample]
"Drug dealer, been that nigga half my life
Drug, drug dealer, been that nigga half my life
You niggas talking, but you ain't never them
Imagine been first name basis with the kingpin"

[Joell Ortiz]
God I was Lucifer's neighbor
You wouldn't believe some of the things these people do for this paper
Moving with lasers and the rugers, make a move, you make the papers
Lose-lose situation, sweat up blood, you get to choose what you bath in
A chemist cook work, the runner's foot work
The customs took work, the soldiers put work in
On any one of them muthafuckas who fuck up good work
Bosses tell 'em good work, that just how the hood work
Northface bubble with eight bundles under it
Gold front upper lip smile while I was hugging it
I lied, I wasn't Lucifer's neighbor, he who I'm fucking with
My mom blew that snow in her nose, but I would hustle it
Champ hoodie, mongoose with the pads
Clap your stoup up, hit mom dukes in the legs
That's beef, nigga, ya'll ain't street niggas
Ya'll peep niggas, write it down and try to be niggas
Fucking everything, neck heavy swing
Second hand swept across that pretty break leg
In that Nissan Honda Chevy thing, peddling
Whatever bring, fetti' in, steadily I fed my whole time

[Chorus]

[Pusha T]
In this art of war, my pen stroke is Picasso
Niggas get the picture, I ain't gotta paint the nostrils
You know my origin is over, when
Fat black bitches singing over organs
Die for a dollar, pride you don't swallow
You save that for the one you buying red bottoms
Yuck, that's the price you gotta pay for it
Alls fair love and war, she masquerade for it
Woo, Jack-O-Lantern Push
Trick or treat, fucking shit, I earned it off the books
Now listen to me vent, when you sit and watch
It's like tires being spinned, shots from everywhere
But they never make a dent, knight in shining armor
Mistake me for the villain, cuz my vengeance is your karma
Yeah, fear is knowing your a goner
It's music to my soul cuz it's death before dishonor, gone

[Danny Brown]
Got the tongue of a pimp, raised by a dirty preacher
That used the church money, to cop a new beemer
Got the heart of a child, raised by a prostitute
That bought his mama the rubbers when the john came through
It's the microphone methadone, bringers of that extra stone
You ain't getting pussy like your prom date had a chaperon
Popping pills, got a nigga brain like a labyrinth
Called the ho on purpose but I got the brain on accident
Niggas, I'm your majesty, show up with a bag of weed
Roll a blunt so perfect, thought it came up out a factory
My manuscript be the man with the boldest grapes
The insomniac with nightmares in sixteens
I'm a wet dream, dry sense of humor
Travel in class like a high school rumor
No one really cares if your embarrass us with style
Cuz when it comes to them raps, you been letting us down
So tell 'em why you mad, son, gotta get it off your chest
Let 'em know how you feel, son
Ya'll gotta say what you gotta say
It don't matter, they gon' say a nigga hating, anyway
