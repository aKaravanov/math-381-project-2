[Pusha T - Chorus]
Beef is best served like steak, well done get a gun to your face, bitch nigga
Beef will have you praying to God, move your kids have you hiding your mom
Beef is when you hide behind them other niggas, but they ain’t killas
They ain’t pulling them triggas, fuck nigga
Beef will have you keying our cars, heart broke yours don’t look like ours

[The-Dream - Hook]
Them niggas ain't dying for you
Them niggas ain't dying for you
(Throwing that flag up, thinking you hot shit taking half of everything you get)
Them niggas ain't dying for you
Them niggas ain't dying for you
And we know that

[Pusha T - Verse]
Contract all fucked up, I guess that means you’re all fucked up
You signed to one niggaa, that signed to another nigga, that signed to three niggas, now that’s bad luck
Damn that shit even the odds now, you better off selling this hard now
You call that living out your dreams?
You can’t fly without your wings, you get it
Jeremy Scott’s all camouflage, you can’t hide it from yourself career sabotage
I was really in that Travelodge, you just lying through your catalogues
Where the blood and the battle scars, we the ones the judge juggling them gavel’s on
Put me to the body nigga, first 48 put us to them bodies
Round here we don’t play that, A-to-the-K that, spray that, lay back
You can keep your beats nigga, we much rather shed your bitch nigga, bitch nigga
3 million can’t hide that, it shows in the homes I done tried that
That’s why you’ll never be my neighbors, smile as you waving but we know you niggas hate us
Fuck you playing games for, don’t be scared get everything you came for
They got you talking that big shit, little do you know we don’t miss shit
Them niggas using you as a pawn, you see they never loaded their guns
Now you out here all by yourself, ask Steve Jobs wealth don’t buy health
Yeeeah

[Pusha T - Chorus]
Beef is best served like steak, well done get a gun to your face, bitch nigga

Beef is when you hide behind them other niggas, but they ain’t killas
They ain’t pulling them triggas, fuck nigga
Beef will have you keying our cars, heart broke yours don’t look like ours

[The-Dream - Hook]
Them niggas ain't dying for you
Them niggas ain't dying for you
(Throwing that flag up, running round, you hot shit, taking half of everything you get)
Yeah, them niggas ain't dying for you
Them niggas ain't dying for you
(And we know that)
