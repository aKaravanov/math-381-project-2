[Intro: Popcaan]
This type of shit happen everyday
All of them that talk hard softer than clay
None of them have the guts to rise it and spray
None of them have the guts to bust the sk

[Chorus: Travi$ Scott]
I got diamonds on my blocka
Servin' to my flocka
Yeah, that's my flocka
To my flocka
Pray to lord on my shotta
She be poppin'
Yeah, that's my flocka

[Verse 1:]
All praise to the most high on both sides
I pray to God, I pray for hard; I won't lie
Multi 'cause I'm dope-tied, convo and a boat ride
Rental cars for the whole month, drop porsche money, no co-sign
Yeah, my records ain't got to sell, nigga (whoo!)
Go diamond off of my cell, nigga
Give a fuck what you sells
That chance come, I take mine
I ball hard and you bench ride, so fuck you and yo' baseline
No soundscan for a bricklayer
Square nigga, you a brick hater
We see a bitch, you fall in love
I fall back 'cause my bitch date her
Where I'm from we go crazy with them choppas
Sellin' dope, going diamond on my blocka

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Welcome to my blocka, take a look at my world
Diamonds on my blocka, all we got is white girl
All we got is choppas, all you hear is choppas
All we see is choppas, that spotlight on my blocka
Dopeboy to the rescue, bad bitches get the best view
Lotta money just floatin' round; all dem hoes feelin' special
I know the rent due; fuck me right and it's sent through
Third time you done used the line; God damn, she a pimp, too
Teamwork makes the dream work; all my niggas done seen work
All my niggas ain't make it through; so much death that my dreams hurt
Where I'm from we go crazy with them choppas
Sellin' dope, going diamond on my blocka

[Chorus]
