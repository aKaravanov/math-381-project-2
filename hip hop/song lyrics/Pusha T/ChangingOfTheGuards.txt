[Diddy]
Heavy is the head that wears the crown
These niggas head’s is too light
Put the Fear of God in these niggas Pusha

[Pusha T]
Its like the changing of the guards
We changing out the frauds
Gave these lions heart like my name ended in oz
Long time coming, Sam Cooking up these bars
Still Eddy Caning see the fiends sunk in jaws
Pusha ton, pledge allegiance to the raw
No dope dealer that escape without a scar
I'm Buddy Lee so lucky me, see I’m home
Wish I could jailbreak my team like an iPhone
Squilly told me take this motherfucker by storm
Get the money and they bitches, bring the prize home
So as I embark, this where the begin start
I write my own happy ending, nigga pen sharp
My life’s a Kodak moment, I need a frame for it
The Penthouse’s bed needs a crane for it.
I'm fuckin on it, exotic bitch out the rainforest
So many bitches its a blur, I take the blame for it
God in heaven knows what I feel inside
Responsible for all this inner-city genocide
I’ll be damned if I lay [?] camp is villify
As I up lift this arch for them ceiling high
I can identify with your one death
We lose thousands over here, you speakin one breath
Outsiders looking in like using one ref
My zip cam point of view to you is one step
Closer to clarity, not a parody
How cocaine single handedly carried me
Escaped clever through the fox hole narrowly
They kick dirt up on my name until they bury me
I just shake it off, then I shake a leg
A lot of time to make up is what Jacob said
The fans fell for your act, I tell you break a leg
Then guns shots going off that’ll awake the dead
PUSH!
