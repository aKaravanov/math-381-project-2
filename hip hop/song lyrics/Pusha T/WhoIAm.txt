[Hook:]
They said be all you can be
They said be all you can be
I just wanna buy another Rollie
I just wanna pop another band
I just wanna be dope forever
I just wanna be who I am

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
They said be all you can be
They said be all you can be
Always knew I could rule the world
Let's define what my world is
Knee deep in this dope money
Damn near where my world ends
Same block, same rock
I was thinking 'bout murdering
I ain't getting my hands dirty
Let you worry 'bout serving them

[Hook]

[Bridge: Pusha T]
They said be all you can be
They said the truth set you free

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Entrepenuer, strip club connoisseur
Hot fudge sundae, pour it on you hallelujah
Pour it on you hallelujah, pour it on you hallelujah
And I be on my own dick, ain't that much room for you
Red, white, blue, I pledge allegence to the street life
Even if there's left overs I still got to eat right
Got gas in my peace pipe, pink Sprite
She pea poppin her jeans tight
All day I dream 'bout three stripes
We the type of crew to get fresh jet set in her livin' room
Look out at one, got a bad bitch in my swimming pool
Got a bad bitch in my swimming pool
Got a bad bitch in my swimming pool
We the type of crew to get fresh jet set in her livin' room
Look out at one, got a bad bitch in my swimming pool

[Bridge: Pusha T]
They said be all you can be

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Pretty girls is my reputation
One on my arm, that's decoration
Getting to it, no hesitation
To fuck with me you need a reservation
To the top escalating, elevating
Good music legislation, delegatin'
And I mean that shit like exclamation, exclamation, exclamation
And I'm going till I K.O
Eyes closed, I'm OK
All my bitches know they roll
Even when we role-play
My homie got that nine on him
All night and all day
All night and all day
All night like that ish is his mothafucka soulmate
Cause no time for hand in hand
When you got this paper hand in hand
Bitch I'm feeling like a grown ass lil' boy, na na na na na
Bitch I'm feeling like a grown ass lil' boy, cause I still like to get pampered
But don't get it twisted, watch your step and m-m-manners

[Bridge: Pusha T]
They said the truth set you free!

[Hook]

[Outro: Pusha T]
I just wanna be who I am
I just wanna be who I am
Always knew I could rule the world
Let's define what my world is
Knee deep in this dope money
Damn near where my world ends
