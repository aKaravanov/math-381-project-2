[Kanye West]
You like that don’t ya. I wrote it myself by the way
And I don’t mean to be selfish
But I picture myself gettin’ paid
And you might get pneumonia
I'm colder than an elf on a sleigh
Uh, me and Pusha back on it
Now everybody help us Pray.

Lord forgive my sins and all my friends
Dollars make sense, I’m tryna get paid

[Pusha T]
Tryna get saved (too late)
Time to get paid
Got a gun and a stocking mask
Niggas thought I was tryna get waves
I’mma let all ya’ll niggas pray for it
My young niggas knocking off a K for it
Sold my soul on the back end
Only fucking way I’mma pay for it
Front that shit, you put a flame on
My niggas locked in a cage for
They keep telling me to go hard
Number one spot you was made for
Yeah, I made more
Front of the grill, got a racehorse
California Crayola ring
Glow In The Dark like a ‘Ye tour
Fuck niggas steppin’ in my lane for
Not knowing that it’s a landmine
Soon as a nigga feel a cool breeze
Throw the top up like a gang sign
Red or blue, crip or blood
Solitaires, diamond studs like chandeliers I’ma flood
Black Jesus piece like it’s dipped in mud
Fashion God’s, notice mine
Rollarball spikes I’m Pokemon
Paris shit, Louboutin
Under bright lights where do you belong

[Chorus]
Please Lord, yeah, it’s gettin realer everyday
Niggas killin’ niggas, starving acres they can’t find no Yay
See at first they roll around and their bills they cannot pay
So some be trapped and some be dying, bow heads and let us pray
Amen

[Kanye West]
Amen, how many people do you know hatin’?
On your downfall sitting their waitin’
When you shine, wonder what they gonna say then
Everything I do now stadium’s
Tell me what they really gon’ say to him
And I’m headed straight to the ATM
Finna go HAM, finna go in
Nigga you get it when pigs fly, when Yeezy fake
Devil’s pie, piece of cake
Kit-Kat I need a break
God’s child, Jesus Christ
Club like a broken neck, I need the ice
I need the lights
In Egypt they fightin’ for freedom
Cop pull you over no reason, beat him

[Chorus]
Please Lord, yeah, it’s gettin realer everyday
Niggas killin’ niggas, starving acres they can’t find no Yay
See at first they roll around and their bills they cannot pay
So some be trapped and some be dying, bow heads and let us pray
Amen

[Young Jeezy]
I got them units packed in that black van like the A-Team
Even seen ‘em come two tone like a saleen (saleen)
Saleen, Yeah that’s a Mustang
Break ‘em down in the night, that's what I call hustlin’
They say they on they dumb shit, but this is ignorance
Come to warn the timepiece, now that's ignorance
Young, you a fool, I coulda bought some real estate
Instead I bought a half a block, I tried to sew up half the streets
I’m on, 75-75, going for the 25
Guess who’s pickin’ up a trey
Just an ordinary day with extraodinary pay
Extraordinary risk
Can’t even explain, got an extraordinary wrist
I talk it cause I lived it man, this shit ain't really nuttin’ to me
Tell ya like Sosa told Tony: “don't you fuck with me”

[Chorus]
Please Lord, yeah, it’s gettin realer everyday
Niggas killin’ niggas, starving acres they can’t find no Yay
See they flossin’, roll around and their bills they cannot pay
So some be trapped and some be dying, bow heads and let us pray
Amen
