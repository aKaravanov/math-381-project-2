It's everything that glitter
That ain't gold
I'm getting low
From the haters
Cameras in action, tell all my niggers what's happening
And ridin with my niggas,
It's everything that glitters, that ain't gold, I'm getting low,..
And all the smoke get high, high, high
Just another day, get by, get by, get by

For every brick broke down it's one stepped on
For every known rat it's one slept on
For every loyal nigger fronting one kept owing For every bitch I show the way it's one kept hoe'in
So let's blow through this money as we pour bottles
Let me drop another classic and the tour follows
Let's get pissy drunken, let the hoes swallow
My niggers embrace guns and ignore bibles
Not to glorify it, you can't ignore the lions
Illusions we can be you, get'em law abiding
Better know who that is looking in the mirror
The truth lies you and you see you can't see it clearer

I'm looking in the mirror
It's everything that glitter
And they know I'm from the haters
Cameras in action, tell all my niggers what's happening
And now I'm with my niggers,
It's everything that glitters, and they know

I'm looking in the mirror
It's everything that glitter
And they know [?] from the haters
Cameras in action, tell all my niggers what's happening
And now I'm with my niggers,
It's everything that glitters, and they know
And all the smoke get high, high, high
Just another day, get by, get by, get by

I just can't leave it alone
I just can't leave it alone
They handing out football numbers at the tap of your phone
Were you watching for the drop as they clapping and they chrome
Took a brick then I turned it to stone
5 into ten the return of the clones
And took my experience and turned it to poems
As we took single engines and turned em to boeings
Panamera blood red symbolized bloodshed
Lost a lot of niggers, some in club fed
Few still reminiscin in they cl,
Servin pete rock cruisin in they v12

I'm looking in the mirror
It's everything that glitter
And they know [?] from the haters
Cameras in action, tell all my niggers what's happening
And now I'm with my niggers,
It's everything that glitters, and they know
And all the smoke get high, high, high
Just another day, get by, get by, get by.
